''ifi LETTERS To MR. MACKENZIE.

edition of the original, the translation may not exactly cor-'-
respond with any single edition that may now be found.
From having compared the original and translation of a
few passages and parts of poems man)r years ago, the
impression that remains upon my mind is, that the liberty
taken was no more than I thought allowable3 and I am
persuaded, that it would have appeared to be still less if I ·
'had the translator's own edition. ἢ
ln what I have said, I wish to be understood as speak-
ing only of the first volume published by Mr Macpherson,
of which a number of the poems, episodes, and incidents
were known to me in the original: and as some of these
were among the most beautiful in the collection, I can easi-

of it in the original, except what relates to the death of
Oscar. l thought, too, when I read it, which was along
time ago, that the stile of some parts of it was more curt,
abrupt, and affected, than the rest of the poetry of Ossian.

much liberty in any part of his work, it was in this; in
which he seems at least to have condemned and fettered the
sense, more than perhaps the genius of the original would
well bear. 1 do not recolleet whether this observation
may be justified by the specimen of the original which I
had seen, published with the first editi0n3 but I recollect,
that upon comparing that specimen with the translation,
l observed several words of which (as I thought) the able ·
translator inadvertently mis-took tho meaning, which could
not well be supposed to have been the case, if, as some al-
ledged, any par-t of it was of his own composition. As
