LETTERS To DR. 'BLA1R.· Ἴ 9

¹ publication, I have carefully compared the translation with
’ the copies of the originals in my hands, and find it amazv-
ingly literal, even in such a degree, as to preserve, in some
” measure, the cadence of the Gaelic versificati0n‚ I need
‚ not aver, Sir, that these poems are taken in this country to
be of the utmost antiquity. This is notorious to almost all
those who speak the Gaelic language in Scotland. In the
Highlands‚ the scene of every action is pointed out to this
day; and the Historical Poems of Ossian have been, for
ages, the winter evening amusement of the clans. Some
of the hereditary bards retained by the chiefs‚ commit-
ted very early to writing some of the w'orks of Ossian.
One manuscript in particular was written as far back as
“ the year 1410, which Ι saw J'n ΜΓ RIacpherson's posses-
sion. Permit me, Sir, as a Highlander, to make use of
this opportunity to thank you, for the pains you have
taken to illustrate the beaufies, and establish the reputation,
of the poems of Ossian, which do so much honour to the
ancient genius οἱ our country. I am, with great esteem,
“ ’ Sir,
Your most obedient servam,
LACHLAN M'PHERsoN.

dated Sle'at, 27th November 1763.

DEAR Sm,

Soon after your letter came to hand, I
wrote upon the subject of it to several gentlemen who live
v at a considerable distance from the place of my residence‚

and did myself the pleasure at the same time fo examine,
in compliance with your request, all the persons in my
neighbourhood that could be of any service.
