oF MR. m’PHERson’s JUVENILE Pomm.

 

1. Extract from a Poem ΟΝ DEATH.

 

O mscmm! gnashing fury! rav'nous flend!
Hell’s sharpest torment! nauseous qualm of life Ξ
You bathe the poniard oft in friendship's breast 2
Peace‚ virtue, friendship, harmony and love,
Delightful traIn of graces, shrink from thee 3
Vice, envy, villany, deceitful thoughts,
Blood-thirsty cmehy, insatiate pride,
War, woe of mothers and new-married maids,
Attend thy shrine, and thence long-plighted league>
And unity are broke, thence streams of blood
Flow from the patriot’s honest-thinking heart3
And rapine, bloodshess carnage-train of death,
Resistless, restless, tear th'unhappy world
