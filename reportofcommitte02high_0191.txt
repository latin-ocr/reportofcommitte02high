fiijself 3 yet the elder Clanranald declared, before another
ζ. ¹clergyma'u and myself, that he had himself transcribed

'above one hundred pages of a large ancient manuscript

which treated of the wars of Fingal and Comhal his fa-
ther; which manuscript has been carried over to Ireland
⁵² some time ago by a worthless person, in a clandestine man-
ner, andis now, it is thought, irrecoverably lost3 but the
manscript, he' directed Mr Maepherson, when on his tour

’ through' the Highlzmds, to recover out of the hands of one

Donald M‘Donald‚ late merchant in the* Luckenbooths,
Ediuburgh, who had got it, though not from Clanranald,
with a view to publish it along with some other Gaelic
pieces. “

Mr M‘Donald of Demisdahi, a parishioner of mine,
declared before me that he remembers to have seen and
’ read, a considerable Part of th'e said ancient manuscript;
and rehearsed from memory‚ before me, some passages of it
that agreed exactly with the translation, viz. the terms of
peace proposed by hlorla in Swaran’s name to Cuchullin ;
Fing. Book ii. p. 26. Likewise‚ Fingal’s orders for raising
his standands, his orders to his chiefs before the battle, the
chiefs resolutions thereupon of fighting each of them a
Lochlin chief ; contained in pages 57 and 58 of Fingal,
book iv'. He concluded with rehearsing the description of
the single combat between Fingal and Swaran, which in
the original is expressed in the strongest language, and per-

= fectly agreed with the translation, which is very just here

and in all the other places I had occasion to compare. The
passage alluded to, is Fiugal, book v. page 652.-

The next I examined was o'ne Archibald M‘Lellan,
likewise a parishioner of mine, who repeated before· me, in
Gaelic, Ossian’s account of his own courtship of Everala
rin at the lake of Lego, without any material variation
