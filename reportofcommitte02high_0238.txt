ESQ Secretary to the Highland Society‚ dated Musset-
bmgh‚ 91h januaty 1802.

Dm< sm,

An accident has brought to my remem-
brance an engagement Ῑ made to yon many months ago,
which I now shall endeavour to fulfil. The subject may
nothe important, but the age of the witness admonishes
him to give his evidence without loss of time.

On the 2d day of October 1759, (l happen to know the -
<iate exactly)‚· I carne from the neighbourhood ofDumfries
to hloffat in the morning, and finding john Home, the‘
author of Douglas, there, I resolved to stay all day with
him. In the course of our conversatio& he told me that'
he had at last found what he had been long wishing for,
a person who could make him acquainted with ancient
Highland poetry‚ of which he had heard so much. This· ’
was Jarnes Maepherson‚ who was then tutor to Mr Gra* ῑ,
ham of Balgowan, whom he had, with much solicitation ⁴]
and difficulty, prevailed with to translate some 'specimensr' ἰ
of that poetry which he had by heart, but which5 he said,
he could not do justice to in an English translation. Mr
Home had been highly delighted with thern3 and when he·
showed them to me, I was perfectly astonished at the poe-
tica] genius displayed in them. W‘e agreed· that it was a
precious discovery, and that as soon as possible it should‘
be published to the world. ΜΓ Home carried the manus
script with him 'soon after to Edinburgh3 and having.
shown it to Dr Blair, and other good judges, they were: ¹ !
so much pleased that they encouraged Mr Macpherson to- ,ο
publish them without delay, which he did early in the
year 1760, with the title of Fragments (ff Ancient Poepry's
collected in the Highlcmdsq
