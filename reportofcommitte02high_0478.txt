302 ACCOUNT oF

The test which such an agreement alfonis, at a distance
of almost 300 years, of the fidelity of tradition, cannot but
seem curious to such as have not had an opportunity of ob-
serving the strength which memory can attain, when unas..
sisted by writing, and prompted to exertion by the love of
poetry and song. With this view the following instances
are given 2

1. Α poem by Conal son ofEdirskeol (p. 205 ofour MS)
nearly agrees with one in Kennedy’s collection, p. 69. Some
of the names are different, and the sentences are not all in the
same order. The four last stanzas but one of Kennedy’s co·
py, are entirely wanting in this. They are superior to the
general tenor of the poem, which exhibits a singular mixture
of barbarous revenge and generous sentiment.

The same poem appears with a few lines more or less,
and a slight variation of words and arrangement in the last
of the Kilbride MSS. (Fol. 83.) above noticed‚ and in two
several editions communicated to the Society, the one by

Robert Campbell Esq. advocate, from the recital of an old {y
man in Ila, and the other by Mr. Malcolm M‘Donald,
Tarbert, from the recitation of Donald Mac Callum in “4

Kilcaltnonell of Kintire.

2. A poem by Ossian (p. 220.) on the failure and fall ‘
of Dayro bor'b, son of the King of Sora, differs very little y
from Kennedy’s and other oral editions in the possession of
the Society‚ in which the hero’s designation‚ however, is Jff'

M ayro borb.

The four concluding verses which are given by our MS. Ξ
as a separate reading, are omitted in some of the oral edi- ⁸2⁵⁴
flons, and retained in others. Kennedy’s edition has twelve ¹
lines (being the 3d and 4th stanzas of his 24th page, and
the 3d stanza of his 25th) which are not in the Dean’s, a‘nd ’μζ

seem to have originally belonged to a different poem.

 

 

3. Α poem by Ossian (p. 63.) descriptive of a chace,
the most successful that Fingal was ever engaged in, corre- ’ ‚
