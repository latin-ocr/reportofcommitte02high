got copies written in the country from his own oral recita-
tion. Declares‚ That he 15 about sixty-six years of age,
and that he has heard the song called Rann na Duan na
h’Ighinn, recited by several persons in Glenorchay above
forty years ago, and about thirty years ago he learnt it by

f beart from John M⁶Nicol tenant 111 Arivean 111 Glenorchay‚

who had got the same from Duncan M‘Nicol tenant in the
same place, his grandfather: That John M‘Nicol died about
twenty years ago, and was above sixty at his death3 and

, that the said Duncan M‘Nicol his grandfather, died about

forty or fifty years ago, and was, as he believes, about
eighty years of age at his death: That the lW‘Nicols in
Arivean‚ who had been there for ages‚ were celebrated for
reciting songs and poems, particularly the songs or histories
of the Fingalian race: That in former times in the decla-
rant's first remembrance, and he believes long before his
time, it was the constant amusement or occupation of the
Highlanders in the winter time to go by turns to each
other’s houses in every village to recite and hear recited or
sung the Poems of Ossian and other song-s and poems;
which was particularly the practice of the M‘Nicols in

’ Arivean3 but that for thirty years back, this practice has

’ been gxadually wearing 0111 111 Glenorchay‚ and in every

other part of the Highlands with which he is acquainted‚
so that it scarcely now exists at all any where. He fai-ther
declares, That when James M‘Pherson was collecting the
Poems of 0551311, 116 applied to the said John MssNicol,
but what songs or poems 116 got from M⁶Nic01 the decla-
rant does not know, and he recollects seeing M‘Pherson 011
that occasion, at the house of Mr. M‘Vean, the minister of
Glenorchay. Fletcher farther declares, That he heard 1116
song called Teannachd mor na Feinne, repeated by many

x persons in the Highlands sas far back as· he can remember
’ ‚any thing, and that some time ago, he learned it by heart,
