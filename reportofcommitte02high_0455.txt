MR. MACKENRIE- . 283

your assistance in enabling them to lay before the public,
Ϊ took occasion, in going to Inveraray, 'to call on Mr.
BI‘Kinnon at Glendaruel. Reminding him of what had
then passed, and asking whether he had himself seen the

to take inspection, and bring the Society an account of
these and the other MSS. in Major M‘Lachlan's possession.
{Part of these the major afterwards sent to the Society, and
