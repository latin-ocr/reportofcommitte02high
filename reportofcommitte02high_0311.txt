- 13:1ng -which acknowledges no other term for giant than

Tfhe astonishing tale of Uv avat‚ not unlike m its effect to
ἕλητὶιαῐ by which ‘the fair Desdemona was w ooed, made so
ntrohg an impression on the imagination of our author, that
she believed the original of a poem, which he gives in Eng-
11511. only, represented Osear as a giam, and as killing nine
[iffi scote men at one stroke. He believed, even 13111161, that
{Vrbe title of great hero meant giant in the Esse.
j· To a determined believer 111 81111115, ‘⁶ trifles light as air-.-
6', -“ are confirmation strong—like proof of sacred writ3 '' so
{i that the following verse was considered as affording ample
ᾧ evide· 166 of the fact.

,Ψ ‘⁶ carne to destroy us; all these fell by the hand of Oscar
1- “ enraged at the sons of Ireland.’' On which it 15 remark·-
:jj ed 111 a note, “ The original I believe represents Oscar as a
1 ‘⁶ giam, and as killjng these multitudes at one stroke. The

,ἓν Μ1. Mac Ναὶ), who was ‘⁴¹ b) no means deficient 111 111-
“ genuity‚’' gravely signified to Mr. Hill, that those gianis
{3⁹ were deified by their Seots posterity3 iz} which respect, it
2³ss seems, they resembled certain demi-giants of (316666, and
’ the northern parts of Europe. ‘⁶ According to 'Mac Nab,
ἕ (says he), Fingal 5661115 to have been the Odin ofihe
‘⁶ Scots: for hc said, they had no religion„ prior to Christi..
fsj '⁴‘ anity, but the reverenee of Pingal and his race†.’' And,
s, again, ‘‚‘ I have before remarlmd, {hat Mac Nab described
ἱ ’Ἴ“ Fingal as the Odin of the 500133 and that the song called
.“ Urnigh 05511111, speaks of him as such—The gods of 1111
λ“ the northern natione 566111 to have been of this class:
