pherson‚ translator of Offianffs poernS, waS‚ for some
years before he entered on that work, my intimate
acquaintance and friend. When he returned from
his tour through the Western Highlands and Isszmds,
he cameto my house in Brae-Badenoch ·. I inquired
the success of his journey‚ and he produced several
volumes, small octavo, or rather large duodecimo,
in the Gaelic language and characters, being the
poems of Offirm, and other ancient bards.

I remember perfectly, that many of those volumes
were, at the close, said to have been collected by
Paul Macmhuirich Bard Clanraonuil, and about the
beginning of the l4th century. Mr Macpherson and I
were of opinion, that though the bard collected them,
yet that they must have been writ by an ecclefiastic‚

and correct. Every poem had its first letter of its
first word most elegantly flourished and gilded 3 some
red, some yeHow, some blue‚ and some green: the
material writ on seemed to be a limber, yet coarse
and dark vellum z the volumes were bound in strong
parchment: Mr Macpherson had them from Clan-
ronald.

At that time Ι could read the Gaelic characters,
though with difficulty, and did often amuse myself
with reading here and there in those poems, while

x Mr Maepherson was employed on his transsation.

At times we differed as to the meaning of certain
words 1n the original.
With much labour I have recovered some scatter-
