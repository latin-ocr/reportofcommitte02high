LETTERS '1²0 MR. MACKENZIE. ’ῑά

The most formidable objections that have been urged
against the authenticity of Ossian’s poems, are those that
are founded, or pretended to be founded, on history; so
that, besides getting answers to the printed queries‚ even
if these should be satisfactory, it would be necessary to ’
employ considerable historical resena-ch, in order to answer
such objections. You mention one made by Gibbon.
Whether he may be right or wrong in his assertion, (for
i his assertions are not always to be trusted‚) I have no op-
portunity of examining: at any rate, I think Ossian is
clear of this objecti0n; for the Gaelic word is obviously
an epithet, (signifyingfierce-qye,) and might be as appli-
· cable to any other as to the emperor Caracalla. If Mr
M‘— in applying this epithet to Caracalla, should be
found in a mistake, as I apprehend he is in this, and in
one or two similar cases3 his mistakes‚ in my opinion,
make rather for than against the authenticity of the poems,
as a forger would not, by his own unnecessary commenta-
, {ies or conjectures, abstract from the credit of his text.
