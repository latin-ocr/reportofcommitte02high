{mems- We admired the purity of the sti1e3 we were
‘much charmed with the descriptions contained in them ; and
some of the sentiments were noble and sublime: to this
end, we informed ourselves as to those old people that
could repeat parts of them, and got their name, but we
could not, from the best informati0n‚ learn that there was
any manuscript of them in this part of the kingdom. We
indeed got a long list of poems, said to be composed by
Ossian, and wrote some of them, viz. such as we found

to answer our expectation33 however that gentleman’s
death put an end to that scheme. WVhen I heard of Μι-

Maepherson’s translation, I was very curious to see iti but

This could be done at a small expence3 andis Dr Blair
would but propose it to some generous'peoplffi they would.
contribute ten pounds, which would execute the scheme,
and these venerable productioris would be preserved.

Many of them indeed are lost, partly owing to· our
clergy, who were declared enemies to these poems 3 so that

them. However, we have still some that are famous fot
repeating them, and these people never heard of ¹Mr Mac-
