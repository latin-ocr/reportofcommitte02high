Literal Transsation.

⁵ Innistore rose ssowly,
And Carrickthura‚ chiefof waves δέ.

Macpherson's Transsation.

‘ Innistore rose to fight‚ and Carrickthura‘s mossy towers.⁹

In the original there is no rising· to sight, no mossy
towers ; but the pieture, vivid 50 the imaginafion, is
fimple in the expreffion ε ‘ Innistore rose slowly?
with that ssowness with which a distant obje& rises
to the fight-—and ‘ Carrickthura, chief of waves ς’
expresfing the fituation of the place in a command*-
ing point of view, above the sea.

‘ Bha combara beud gu h-ard
Teine dall ’s a thaobh san smfiid!

‘ The fignal of evil (or violence) was on high, ⁵
A blind fire, with its fide in smoke.’

‘ But the fign of distress was on their top3 the warning
‚flame edged with smoke.³

I 2 'Having

ἓξ i. e, Rismg majestioassy above the sea„ lui), in the We&
Highlands‚ is used to express a land-mark.
