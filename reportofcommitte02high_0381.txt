Which are 'advancing towards us 3
Like a hart driven to fury,
Like a hawk among a ssight of birds,
Or a ruthless eagle pouncing in his strength.
Within the car is the strong-armed hero of swords,
Whose name is Cuchullin‚ the son of Semo,
Son of Suvalta‚ son of Begalt.
His red cheek is like the polished yew :
Lofty the look of his blue-rolling eye beneath the arch of his
His bushy hair is a waving flame, [browae
As coming towards us, a fiery holt,

’ He wields both his forward spears0

’Ἀθ ἣε ἥὲ

Like furious storms which come darkly frowning,
And rend the rocky peaks from their hius,
Toward each other approached the hostile heroes.

, Like cataracts which fall from mountains,

To mi,v in the narrow pass of the desert,
Rough and instant we joined battle

, To the'breast of Lochlin's king and his mighty hosi„
· Chiefs opposed shield to shie1d3

Men met sword to sword⁵

The look of his blue-rolling eye is wide, beneath the dark
arch of his brow0 His hair flies from his head like a flame,
as bending forward he wields the spear. Ib. P· 23¹9
