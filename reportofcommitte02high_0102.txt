King's Hundey, intimating, in answer to the inqui-
ries of the Highland Society‚ that he had a book in
his poffeffion, containing Mr Macpherson's first es-
says in English poetry‚ which he did not choose‚ or
conceive himself at liberty to rescue from that obli-
vion to which the author seemed to have configned
it. Now my Lord‚ whether this MS. volume be
Macpherson'·s poetical common-place book, con-
taining those claffical quotations which he transfer-

Engliffi poetry‚ such important evidence ought not
to be suppreffed. Nothing has appeared more satis-
factory to impartial men, unconneffted with the
Highlands‚ than the discovery of a prior epic poem
by Maepherson, containing the same sentiments‚ ima-
gery, and expreffions with his Offian3 and as the
same resemblance may be traced in his leffer poemS,
lately publifhed from the Scots Magazffle, ΔΙ am
entitled to conclude, that those first effays of his
muse in English, if fairly produced, would afford
the same convincing deteffions of Ossian. It is in
vain to say that Mr Anderson is not at liberty to

produce
