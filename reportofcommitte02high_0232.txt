that for some months he left all the originals of his trans}
lation open to inspection and examination, in Becket the ξ’
bookseller's shop, and intimated, by advertisement in the ξξ
Newspapers‚ that he had done so, But when, after their
being left there for a considerable tiine, he found tha't no ’
one person had ever called to look at them, his disdain of Ψ,
public censure became still stronger. I urged him to write Ῐ.
to the Highlands for authentic testimonies from some of
those gentlemen from whom he received his materials. He ,·’
utterly rejected this proposal, as implying a public distrustv ¹.
of his veracity; but at the same time consented to my=
making some enquiries of this nature, which he* thought? -·
might come more suitably from me than from himself.⁴
Accordingly, from my zeal to throw every light ..upon tho ζ
subject, I did write to a' number of gentlemen in the High- ”
lands, many of them of the most respectable rank and chazv ‘³
racter, requesting information of what they knew respect- ’
ing the originals of those poems of which ΜΓ Macpherson Δ
had published a translation. The result of their testimony
I gave in a printed Appendjx to my Dissertation on the· ,ἑ
Poetry of Ossian, furnishing, I think, strong and irrefra- ³ Ῐ
gable evidence in favour of the authenticity of the poems 2
now given to the world as genuine productioris of ancient ζ’
Highland bards. ¹ '. ³
For my own part, from my perfect knowledge of all the‘· ἶ
circumstances of their discovery and translation, it was irn-r'sss.
possible for me to entertain any doubts on the subject offffq'w
their authenticity. Of all the men I ever knew, Mr Maca ’ ¹
pherson was the most unljkely and unfit to contrive antii} '¹
carry on such an imposture, as some peoplev in Englancs'f'
ascribed to him. He had none of the versatility, the art7³¹

and dissimulation, which such a character and such an un-W‘?⁴

dertaking would have required. He *was prend, high-spis}
rhed, and disdainful 3 irritable to a degree, when his honour}

and veracity were irnpeached; not ver?r apt, on any occa-‘- ’
