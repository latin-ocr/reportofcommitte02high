and thence in Ireland are to be found numerous his-
torical documents and records, which the antiqua-
rian looks for in vain among any archives or collec÷
tions of antiquities in Scotland. It is observable,
however, that most of the copies of the ancient Fin-
galian poenis, brought from Ireland, are either whol-
ly, or at least contain passages, evidently corrupt*
ed, and of a more modern stile ‘of composition, than
poems under fimilar titles collected in the High-
lands of Scotland. Even those publilhed by Mis„-
Brooke, though of very great merit on the whole,
bear strong marks of this departure from the ancient
fimplicity which marks the collefflon made by Dr
Smith, or even most of that made by Kennedy. ³³
One very conspicuous feature of difference is the
magical machinery of some of the Irish poemS, a
very beautiful specimen of which is given by Miss
Brooke, in the poem of the Chace, trassated by her.

iffi king,' which Miss Brooke confeffes is a strange passage which-
ihc is unable to account for. And in the poem of ,Molre berb.
a< given by her, which bears a close affinity to the Borbar and
istdmsolliffls of llsIacphfrjfhn‚ there is a paffage fignifying that
thr: foreign hero rode over the sea on a magical horse. (Miss
Ernst-lv, p. 128.)
