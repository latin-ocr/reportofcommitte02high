110· LITERAL TRAnsxssAnoN‘

Would it had been in'the strife of heroes,· '
That Fraoch the bestowet of gold had fallen.
Sad is 1115 having fallen by a monster,
YVoesul it is to< survive him !

Blacker than 'the raven was the grow‘ah of his hair,
Redder was his cheek than the blood of the fawn;

Smoo‘ther tha-n the foam of streams,
Whiter than snow was the skin of Fraoch.

Stronger t-h-an a gate was Iris shield,
RIany a hero gathered around it ;
Long as his sword was his arm,
Broad as the plank of a ship was his blada.

TaIler than a mast was his spcar,
Sweeter than the string of music was his voice,
A swimmer who excelled Fraoch
Never laid his side to a stream.

Good was the strength of 1115 arms,
And exceeding good was the swiftness of his feetae
In soul he was superior to a king,
Of champion he never declined the combat.

Lovely was the chief whom the people esteemed,
Lovely the eheek which vied with the rose in 1τ6ἀη655,ι ff
Lovely the mouth which opposed not friendship's cau,
And which the fair declined not to kiss. “

We bore to the grove of Fraoch,
The body of the hero to its circular pale ς,
After the worthy has died,
To be alive is our segra,
