Pei-:MS oF OSSIAN. 51

‘ Osfian and the Clerk‚' sometimes called ‘ the
Battle of Fingal and Manus ς’» ‘ Mar mharbh Diarc}
· ma

Thus, iu p.- 13. l. 47. of Ossian ugus cm Clerich,

‘ Mi sein, agus m’athair, is Gon,
Triur bo mho glonn san fhein,'

is rendered in the transsation given by Mr Hill,

‘ Myself, my father and Gaul, were those
Who had most children amongst our heroes ς’

instead of the true meaning,

‘ Myself, my father and Gaul, were the three
Of greatest prowess among the heroes.’

And again, p. 22. second stanza of Urm'gh Ossian, ‘ Oishein nan
Glonn' is transsated ‘ O! Offian of many child1en,' instead of

‘ O ἔ Offian of the deeds of prowess.’ From which passages Mr
Hill is led to remark, ‘ that being the father of many children is
ever accounted a great honour among barbariam)

At page 24, stanza 18,

⁶ Sgan a chreideas me do sgeul
A cleirieh led leabhar ban

Gum bithidh Pionn na chomh fhial,
Aig duine no aig· Dia an laimh.'

Thus Engliffied in the transsation of Mr Hill :

‘ I can hardly believe thy tale, thou light-haired and unworthy

elerk ! that the heroes of our race should be in captivity either to
the devil or to God.’
