POEMS ΟΡ OSSIAN. 43,

The queries sent me may be elucidated in Bade-
noch and Lochaber. Yon may gather from what
is above, that this corner can do little in that line.

When summer comes, if my health serves me, 1
shall make it my bufiness to see certain old men,
though at a confiderable distance fiom here, who,
1 am told, do still retain some of Offian' s poems.

The gentleman to whom Ι referred in my former
correspondence, as a familiar acquaintance of Mr
Maepherson’s and mine, and distinguished for his
acquaintance with the Gaelic language, is, alas! 110
more. His name was Lachlane Macpherson of
Strathmashy. He died in the 1767. I have the
honour to be, with great respect, Sir, the Highland
Society’Q and your, most obedient humble servant,

ANDREW GALLOE.

In his private correspondence with his friend the
Reverend Dr Kemp‚ Mr Gallie ventured a conjec-
ture with regard to the MSS. procured by MnMac,
pherson, which he had scen in that gentleman’s pos-
sessim, though his modesty had not allowed him to
mention it in a correfpondence of so public a nature
as that with the Committce. This conje&ure is
expreffed in the following extra& of a letter (the
greatest part of which is on private bufincss) to Dr
Kemp.
