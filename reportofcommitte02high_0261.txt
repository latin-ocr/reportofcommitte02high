LETTERS *To MR. MACKENZIE. 89

not opened for many years, a sheet, of an old Gaelic poem,
and m'entioned to a brother of mine, who was with me at
the time, that I had not the least recollection how I came
hy it, upon which he put me in mind that I had told him
when he had seen it, with some others, (above twenty
years ago,) they had been got, (together with a collec-
¹tion of Proverbs sent to Mr Macintosh‚) from Captain
rAlexander Campbell, then chamberlain of Kintyre‚ who
'had them from one William Mac Mumhy, a musician, and
an amateur of ancient poetry. This circumstance I men-
zion, to shew you how little Ι troubled my memor)- with
any particulars relative to these poems. One circumstance,
however, Ι remcmber well, that a man who had given me
the use of a parcel of poems, without any restriction‚ had
long threatened a prosecution for publishing what he called
’translations of his collection of poems, and alledged he had
*a claim to a share of the profits. I believe however, upon
.enquiry, that he understood the profits were only a serious
loss, as I had been persuaded to run shares with a boc-k-
seller in the publication, which to me turned out so bad a
concern (when my income was but thirty pounds a year,)
-that I could never since think of Gaelic poetry with plea-
.sure or with patience, except to wish it had been dead bc-
:fore Ι was born. The circumstance I hare just mention-
ed, may be construed in favour of the authenticity of these
poems; buton the other side, Ι have to mention that, in
>my observing the beauty of one or two passages in one of
,v those poenus, (Ι fei-get which) the person who gave it me
as an ancient poem, said, these were of his own composition.
This assertion, Ι placed then to the account of his vanity3
but Ι think it right to state it to you as I had z't, and leave you
,ιο think of it what you please. I feel no interest in the que-
¹stion‚ in its issue, or in the fate of the poetry. Indeed, Ι
know little of what has been said, pro or con, on the sub-

ject for these many years, having neither the opportunity
