the1ed together, than that which Mr Mac pheison has gi‘v ert
to the public. The world may say of hini and his trans-z
latiens what they please; but Ι am convineed‚ for my]
part, that l heard most of these pooms repeated, since I‘J't'-
rememb ·z³ny thing at ass- and Ι dare say, at t-hat time, ..ᾗ
Mr Maepherson could neiihe1 read noi write, far less be-
the α uthor of such a w mk. '⁹ ’ἵ

T hi's letter, of which you are at liberty to make what*v ἶ
use you please, and the evidence which, in my presence, ἶ
you had from Mx- Macpherson of fflornaway, afford a di„- ¹
rect proof that the poems of Ossian are no imposition uponx ³
*the public. l' know nothing sti-onger that can be offered„ ἶ
‘to remove the doubts that may have been entertained con- ’“
cerning the :authenticity of these poems, and, I am persuad- ³
cd, a single testimony of that kind will give entire satisfac— · ’
tion to every one whoge scruples are not founded on pre· *-
judice.

I have wrote down the passages ⁷which ΜΓ Macpherson ;-
repeated in your house; and every one that reads them, ·.
allows that they lose by the translation. Ἴ

Your acquaintance, Mr Fraser, received a letter from Mt -
Mac Lagan, preaeher at Amalrie, in which he mentions ‘³
eome detached picces he transmitted to Mr blaepherson the ’
Ἦεῃεὴῖοϊ, particularly several passages ⁴in the two last ⁵
'books of Fingal. The poem, called Erragon‚ or Lora, ⁸
*almost entire, and. a poem which bears some resemblance ἶ.
ῖῒο the opening of Temora. I told you formerly that I saw ³>
*the originale. which ΜΓ Maepherson collected 'in' the Hi'gh'. ἕ
¹lands. , Mr F raser will assare you that he saw them like‘- ’ 3
wise, and was frequently present with Mr Maephersoff'-
when lle-was ‘translating them: and no man will say that
2he could impose his own originals upon ns, if we ‘ha-d '³'
common sense, and a knowledge of our mother tongue. ’Ᾰ
