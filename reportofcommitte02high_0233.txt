W >Scepticism has indeed been ,entertained by many, how
’ᾗ far his Work, supposing it to be no imposture on the whole,
, 'could be relied upon as an accurate and faithful translation

he may have combined and brought together some pieces

'find in the old Gaelic songs. But after all the enquiries I

'were simply necessary to connect together pieccs ef one

world, if that publication shall be completed, which Mr

Maepherson had begun, of the whole 60011(- originals in

, on the opposite page. The idea which he once entertain-

ed, and'of which he showed me a specimen, of printing'

,the Gaelic in Greek characters, (to avoid the disputes

about Gaelic orthography), I indeed strongly reprobated,
