73 LETTERS ro MR. MACKENZIEa

author who wrote near the beginning of last century, that ’
St Patrick had actually a convert, a disciple of this name,
,who was afterwards dignified with the title of St Ossin, or ·
Ossian, who is no doubt the speaker in this poem; which
Colgan, who mentions it, observes, could not be ascribed
ro the son of Fingal, who lived long before the time of St ,
Patrick, or, as he says, in the reign of king‘ Cormac.
The same author, in a note to a passage in which mention ·
{s made of Fingal (or Finnius filius Cubhalli),v in one of
the lives of St Columba, says he was much celebrated in
poems and tales inter suos ; by which, Ῑ suppose he means

very satisfying‚ and should make a part of your plan, as
it would not only add to the weight of other evidence, but
go a great length to account for the peculiar manners of
the poetry, and go far to remove some of the strongest
objections that have been made to the authenticity of Os.»
sian. Some of these objections have been occasioned by
’Μι- M.’s notes, and are not chargeable on the poet3 such
as that in which he supposes Ossian's epithet of Car-acui!
or Garghuil, (fierce-eyed) to be a proper name, and to· :
mean Caracalla. I suspect also, that although Lochlar'r
(as appears from several passages of a very ancient Irish
or Gaelic author now before me) was of old a general-
name with us for all Germany as well as scandinavia, Μι-
Μ. may have sometimes implicisly used it (as Ι did mya
self‚) in conformity to oral recitation, without attending ι
always to the circumstances of the case. Our later inter-
