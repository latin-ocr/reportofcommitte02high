106 ALBIN ΛΝΒ THE A

 

The story makes each heart but thine to bleec'i,

And fisss both men and maids with keenest grief ξ
Eehold thy daughter, beauteous as the sky

When early morn ascends yon eastern hius,

She lov’d the youth who by thy guile did die,

And now our ears with lamentatione fills: ¹
'Tis she, who sod, and grovelling on the ground,¹ Ἰ,τιῗ
''x‘v'eeps o’er his grave, and makes the woods resound.

A thousand graces did the maid adom: [Η

Her looks were charming, and her heart was kinds&
Her eyes were like the windows of the mom,
And *vvisdom’s hablmtion was her mind. Ψ
A hundred heroes n‘y’d her love to gain3 ἐ

She pity'd them, yet did their suits deny :
Yonng Albin only courtec‘t not in vain,

Albin alone was lovely in her eye:

Love fill’cl their bosoms with a mutual flame;

Their birth was equal, and their age the same.

Her mother Mey, a woman void of truth, {Q
In practice of deceit and guile grown old, r
Con'ceiv'd a guilty passion for the youth, μ’ ‘¹5:¹32
And in his ear ‘che shameful story told: ” ³¹
But o'er his mind she never could prevai13 a
For in his life no wickedness was found ;-
With shar'ne and rage he heard the horrid tale,
And shook with indignation at the sound=t ts ¹ ἦ
He fied to shun her 3 while with burning wrath Ι 1
The monster, in revenge, decreed his death-

Amidst Lochmey, at distance fnom the shore,
On a green island, grew a stately tree,
Vvsith pfecious fruit each season cover'd 0-'er‚,

Delightful to the taste and fair to see: ‘ ,
