person has left so little vestige behind. It was a language
spoken in the cottage, but not in the parlour, or at the
table of any gentleman. Its greatest elegancies were to
be learned from herdsmen or deer-stealers. It was con·-
nected with disaffection, and proscribes] by government.
’ Schools were erected to supplant it, by teaclflng a different
language. There were no books in lt, but the manuals of
'religiom and these in so aukward and clumsy a spelling
that few could read them. The fashionable world 'in the
neighbourhood, as usual, derided the tone and accent of
Highlanders, believing their own to be moclels of elegance
and harmony. It was more gentcel to bc ignorant than
'knowing of what such a lang-uage contained, and it re-
quired all the· genius, learning, and courage of James lWac- ,
pherson‚ to perceive and affirm that the ancient strains of
Gaelic poetry might compare with those of other nations
more celebrated. If it should still remain a questionwith
many, whether he collected or composed these strains, I
shall not be surprised; for Ι believe, that what he got in
writing was unknown to those who gave it, and the merit
of what was repeated scarcely felt. And, in short, that he
himself at times was not averse to be thought the author
of what became so much celebrated and admired through-
out Europe.

In writing so much, and so little to the purpose of the
Committee’s letter, I trust to your usual favour ancl good
nature in helping me to the proper excuses ς and am, with
the most sincere and perfect regard,

⁶ My Dear Sir,
Your most obedient, and
most humble servant,
ADAM FERGUssoN.
