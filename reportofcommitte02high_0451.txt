DECLARATION. 279

't away by Alexander, son of the Rev. Alexander Macdonald,

and others by Ronald his son; and he saw two or three of
them cut down by tailors for measures. That he remem-
bers well that Clanronald made his father give up the red
book to James Macpherson from Badenoch3 that it was
near as thick as a Bible, but that it was longer and broader‚
though not so thick in the cover. That the parchments
and the red book were written in the hand in which the
Gaelic used to be written of old both in Scotland and Ire-
land before people began to use the English hand in writing
Gaelic, and that his father knew well how to read the old
hand. That he himself had some of the parchments after
his father’s death, but that because he had not been taught
to read them, and had no reason to set any value upon
them, they were lost. He says that none of his forefathers
had the name of Paul, but that there were two of them who
were called Cathal.

He says that the red book was not written by one man,
but that it was written from age to age by the family of
Clau Mhuirich‚ who were preserving and continuing the
history of the Macaonalds, and of other heads of Highland
Clans.

After the above declaration was taken down, it was read
to him, and he acknoxvledged it was right, in presence of
Donald M‘Donald oi⁴ ‘ssalronald, James M‘Donald of Gary-
helich, Ewan Mac Donald of Griminish‚ Alexander Mac
Lean of Hoste—r, ΜΓ. Alexander Nicolson minister of Ben-
becula, and Mr. Allan Mac {gueen minister of North-Uist,
who wrote this deciaation.
