The heroes have gone to* the grave

That sees not day,

Which has caused mine eye to be‘in mist.

I am like the lonely wounded bird of the wood,
While I mourn without ceasing in the hall,
Without sight, or offspring‚ or cause of joy.
I am like the tree whose growth has ceased,
Or like the nut in its withered husk,

Ready to drop down to the ground.
Grievous it is to the sorrowful beart,

That it cannot derive relief from friends.
Like the dying hart is my form,

My voice sink's under the dew- of night 2
