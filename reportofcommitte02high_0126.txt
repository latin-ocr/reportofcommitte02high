greater irregularity in the composition, some verses
being very beautiful, both in idea and in language‚
while others are rude and coarse in both. General-
ly Dr Smith's edition of the same poem is much

which the reverse is the case. To a person well ac-
quainted with the Gaelic, it is impoffible for any
transsation to convey the beautiful fimplicity of the
following stanzas in Kennedy's Diarmad, which the
Committee is therefore tempted to give here in the
original, for the amusement, as well as the exami-
nation of the Gaelic scholar 3 subjoining at the same
time a verfion, of which the chief merit is its faitha
fulness, a quality which must however injure both
its smoothness and its dignity.
