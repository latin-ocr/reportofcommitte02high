From its sides of crimson,

Δ Is like the sparkling whirl of the sea .

Round a ship‚ when the moon is not seen on the· flood. .
F irst in the car is found

The grey, the swift‚ the leading horse,
The large, thorough-passing‚ quick-travelling,
The broad-breasted‚ sure-eyed, and equaLpaced,

Ι The high-spirited, well-trained, and wide-leaping steed‚

Whose name is Lia-maishah.
Last in the car is found
The strong-hoofed⁷ and powerful horse,

. The long-flanked‚ proudly bounding‚
r Small-shanked‚ ffiin-maned,

Hi gh-headed, quick-paced3
The light-bellied‚ snorting, eager med,

· VVhose name is Du-sronmor.

In the centre of the car are found,
For the support of the genereus steeds,
The arms known to fame.

The light, broad-plated, dans,
Of rapid ssight and deadly aim.
The narrow, but firm reins.

The precious, highly polished bits, which shine in the mouth.

⁶ Lockers containing coverlets ond glistoning gems,

As mist that scuds along the streamy plain
Is the close and rapid course of the horses )

κ stormy sons of the sword! A thousand thongs bind the car

on high.- Hard polished bits shine in a wreath of foam„

Β ἃΤὶιίη thongs br-ig-ht-studded with gems, bend on the stately

necks of the steeds. The steeds that like wreaths of misr
fly over the streamy vales! The wildness of deer is J'n
