or PASSAGES. 192²

DAoL, who was watching the ocean¹

When high heaved its bfflbws,

Hastened to relate what oc'curred.
‘⁶ Arise, King of Taura !

I see a great fleet'3 I proclaim η

That our harboms ar'e' ³covered with crowds

From the mighty flee‘t'nf the sea-borne foe.

. If this be the Gassve) >‘the son of Stamo,

That terrible metemj'destructive in its course,

He shall bear our 'captives over sea, “

-Nor can the king of full-grown warriors prevent him‚’‘
‘⁶ Thou art deceive& tossdaffi as‘thou always art 3

It is the fleet of the hius that is there,
And the heroes of Fingal· coming to our aid.'”
⁶⁶ Their chief dexterous in arms,
Is a rock bending over our shore.
I beheld the hero like a spreading mist.
[Tau] he seemed as 3 pine of the forest,
In the array of the hosts, close waving
⁷ Like the grass that is moved by the gentle brecze.

 

 

‘⁴ Moran !'’ replied the blue-eyed chief, “thou ever stem„
blest‚ son of Fithil! Thy fears have increased the foe.
Itis Fingal, king of desarts, with aid to green Erin of
‘⁶ streams.’' ᾖ

“ I beheld their chief '' says Moran‚ “tall as a glittering
rock. His spear is a blasted pine.—-He sat* on the shore!
like a cloud of mist on the silent hill !

’ “ Many, chief of heroes! Ι said, many are our hands of
war. Well art thou named the Mighty Man: but ma-

northern nations to distinguish persons by descriptive epithets, The Nor-
wegian Sigurd was named Digri, or the Thick. William King of Scots bore
the synonymous epithet of Garbh; and Canute, who ruled over Dmmark,
England, and» Nom-³5, is known, in the verses of Sighvat his Scald‚ by the
fide bf Digsi. -
