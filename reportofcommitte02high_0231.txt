,. first time entertained the hope that the undertaking to which
I had so often prompted him would be attended with suc-⁶
cess3 that hitherto he had imagined they were merely ro-
·rnantic ideas which I held out to him, but he now saw
them likely to be realized, and should endeavour to aequit
, himself, so as to give satisfaction to all his friends.
Accordingly, he soon after set out on his mission through
the Highlands 3 and during the time he was employed in it,

all know likewise the doubts and scepticism concerning· the
genuineness of his work, which arose in England soon
after the publication of it, and after my Dissertation upon
it was also given to the world. These doubts his temper
led him to disdain; perhaps to disdain too much. So far,
