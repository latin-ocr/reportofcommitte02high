From the mouth of ogau, to speed thee 3-
But I fear thou wilt not return.’

Her perplexity between her desire to go to the as-

’ She glanced by the scanty bearn
On the beautiful face of her son,
When about to leave him in her narrow ss<iff.-—

“ Babe of my love ! be here unobserved !'’—

As a dove on the rock of Ulacha,

When gathering berries for her tender brood,

Returns often without tasting them,

While the hawk rises in her thouglits3

So returned three times Evz'rchoma,

From breaker to breaker, when the tempest blows‚

Disorder'd, uneven in sweat.

And he raised with difficulty his eye.

The beauty of Evirchoma is darken'd.

Her son, namncern’d, holds the end of a spear.
