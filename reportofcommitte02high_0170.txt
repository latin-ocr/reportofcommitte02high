154 REPORT on -ΤΗΕ ἡ

to a man of a sanguine and somewhat εκιιιῐιάειιῐΣ dis--

position like Maepherson, is apt to give a degree of.
carelessness and presumption, that would rather
command than conciliate the public suffrage, “md’‘
in the security of the world' s applause, neglecls ὼε,
best means of obtaining it. He thought, it may be,'
he had only to produce ¹'another work like Finggal,⁴

to reap the same advantage and the 'same honour
which that had procuredl him 3 and was rather so-
licitous to obtain these quickly‚ by a hasty publica-

tion, than to deserve them by a careful colleffion of

what original materials he had procured, or by a
diligent search to supply the defe&s of those mate-
rials.

ΙΙ

The Committee submits this Report to the Society
with confiderable diffidence. It encountered many
more difficulties, and was obliged to bestow more

labour‚ than it was at all aware of, when it under-
took the investigation committed to it by 'tire socie&
ty. That labour has, after all, it is senfible, e‘ffec‘ftss

edsits purpose in a very imperil& manno] but the ,
ι

Committee's inquiries have at least produced some-
thing which it believes the Society will receive with
considerable interest, and the public will not read
with indifference. One merit it, can ven-ture to as-
sume to itself‚ without f- ar of contradicimus-perse&

impartiality and candour ιιι its researcheS, ἢιιᾲ i'n its
Report.
