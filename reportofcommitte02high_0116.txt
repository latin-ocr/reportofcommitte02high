ΙΟΘ REPORT &N THE

In terms of her soft greeting.

The king of aspe& rnild enquired aloud,

From what quarter the fair complexioned maid had come,
Or what land she had left for that of Fingal?

-“ Give us briefly your 1·eport.”

“ Daughter I am to the king of the wave-surrounded land 5-

Its groves proclaim my tearful moans.

But of all the lands which the sun surrounds in his course,

Thine of the genereus brave is that which I fought.”
“ Princess of the easy gait Ξ

Young maid of the perse& form !

The purpose 011 which you came from afar,
Dedan-e, though to me it be bitter.''

“ Thy support I claim, if thou art Fingal ;’'
(Said the maid addressing uS,)

“Por the excellence of thy kingly mien and farne,
Vouchsafe me speedily and seasonably thy prote&i0n.”
‘⁶ Who‚” (said the king who knew afar),

“ Is the person that now pursues you ?

My p1·otec‘³tion‚ O maid ! shall be your defence
Against all who dare.”

‘⁶ There comes with wrath over sea,

A warrior renowned for might in pursuit of me ;
The son of the king of Sora’s land, of keen arms²
whose name is Dayro Borb.

To his suit I opposed a vow,

That Fingal should receive me from off the sea,
And that I should never be his sponse, ’
Though great were his d-eeds, and high his fame.''
Bri r-fly replied, with determined voice,

He who could check each king, ¹

“ Uhtil the men of Fingal break thy vow,

His spouse thou {halt not be.''

We see advancing on the wave

A warrior whose stature none could equal,
Travelling the sea with speed‚

In the very direC’eion the maid had come.
