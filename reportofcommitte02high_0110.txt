Long to me was the night that is past-
For the day that is come Ι have longed--a
While ssowly rossed the day before.
Tedious to me is each day that comeS‚
For it is not as it was wont !

And feats of strength are no longer performed! ι’

Nor power to avenge the feebIC.

No more the love of the fair or of the chace,
In which 1 was wont to take delight.
On the sword or the dart I no longer rcly.
I do not come up with the hind or the hart,
Nor do I traverse the hills of the elk.
