POEMS- OF oss1AN.

The young heroes of Fingal fell,
Adorned with a robe of fame.

The sons of Louach fell,

The fix sons and the father.

The youth of Albion fell,

Slain are the heroes of Britain.
Fauen is the king of Lethlin’s son,
Who always gave us his aid.
Generous and manly was his heart 3
Strong, at all times, was his arm.''
“ But tell me, bard !

The son of my son, and of my loins,

Oscar, how did he hew down the terrible 1131116 3

It were hard to relate,

Great were the task to tell,

The numbers ssain in that battle,

who fell by the arms of Oscar.

Not swifter the catara& of a river,

Nor a hawk darting on a ssight of birds 3

Not stronger the course of the foaming tamn-nt,

Than Oscar in that battle.

He was, at last,

Like a branch that opposes a furious wind,
Or like a tree which budding green
Resists the stroke of the woodman.

WVhen 116 perceived the king of E1in

111 the midst of his host,

Forward Oscai· ruffied,

As rolls a wave to the shore.

As Cairbar saw him approach,

He wielded his keen spear,

And pierced him through with its point-
Oui· chief cause of woe !

Nor yet did Oscar turri,

But forward pushed to Erin’s king:

A wound with might he gave,

Which proved the strength of his 11111136.
