POEMs OF osslAN. 133

It is needless to enter into any particular illustra-
’ tion, to lhew how fimple and natural this picture of
Fingal isin the origina13 how much altered from
that simplicity in Maepherson's transsation. In the
original the picture prompte the word83 in Mac-
pherson's transsation, the expreffion is thought of,
without attending to the picture. Maepherson wishes
to give an explanation or commentary to his reader3
he will not trust to his understanding or feeling the
meaning and force of the simple expression in the
original, ‘ He saw the winds without force‚’. but
tells, by an interpolation, what that expreffion 1111-
ports. ‘ His dtzrkened bro-w bends forward to the
coast ; he looks back to the lagging wlnd.' He makes
his silence terrihle‚ when there was no one to see or
feel terror from it. The original, femin, which it is
difficult to find an exa& English word for, means
something light, vain, that has no consequence 01·
meaning.

‘ Thuit oidhch’ air Rotha nan stuadh 3

Ghabh cala nau cruach an long;
Bha carraig mu iomall a’ chuaiu
Dh⁷ aom coille thar fuaim nau 10111ῑῖ

‘ Night fell on Rotha of tlxe waves ;
The harbour of little hilis received the ffiiy.
There was a rock on the edge of the sea;
The 'wood bending over the found of the waves.'

‘ Night came down on the [ρης Rotha's bay received the
ship. A rock bends along the coast, with all its echoing wood.·'
