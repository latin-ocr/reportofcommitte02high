266 NOTES.

Europe to the eastward, was stamped with the epithet of
Celtic, as was also its westerly point, Cape Finisterre (ld.
L.‚IV. c. 520).

After the great body of Celts had moved from Germany,
in their western progress, across the Rhine, a considerable
number continued to dwell in that country.v For we leam
from Tacitus (de morib. Germ. e. 43, 45.) that the Gal-
lic and Eritish languages, which still distinguish the ge-
nuine posterity of the ancient Celts‚ were spoken so late as
the beginning of the second century by the Gothini and
AEstyii3 and that the Cimbri (Ib. e. 37.), one of the two
denominatione into which the Celtic family branched out
Ι at the earliest period of its history, still continued, though

greatly reduced in number, to oceupy that portion of Ger-
many from which their renowned ancestors had issued
forth in conjunction with the Teutones, 210 years before,
ἵο crush four consular armies, and force the Roman re-
public to the brink of ruin.

So near a neighbourhood-‚hand so long and familiar an in-
tercourse as subsisted between t'he Celts of Germany and the
Teutones, could not 'fail to affect the lang-uage of both.
How far that of the former was affected in this way it is
impossible to determine, Ilfforemarmcz, preserved by Pliny
(Lib. IV. c. ἰὼ), being the only recorded sample of it.
But the extent to which the speech of the latter was enrich-

. ed in this respect, may be judged ofin some measure by
the Scots or Irish‚ and welch words, which are found in
the various dialects of the Teutonic. Some of these are
also common to the Oriental languages and the Greek and .
Latin ; so that they may be fairly presumed to have form-
ed a part of the primitive language of Asia, the cradle of
our race, and to have been brought from thence by the first
