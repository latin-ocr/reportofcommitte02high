The fourth and last MS. of this CoUection that has been

received by the Society consists of various Tales and (Pectus,
ancient and modern. The authors of them are not men-
tioned3 but one of the Poems is ascribed by an older MS.
(that of the Dean of Lismore) to Conal son of EdirskeoL
The Poem that seems to be the best, is a very pathetic one
which was composed on occasion of Archibald Earl of
Argyll being imprisoned in the Castle of Edinburgh about
the year 1680. ⁷
This MS. was written at Aird-Chonail upon Lochowe
in the years 1690 and 1601, by Exi'an Mac Lean for Colin
Campbell‚ as several dates upon it bear3 one of which,
taken from the first page of its 79th leaf, is as follows:

EOGAN BTAC GHILLEOIN—Le mo laimh do crioclmuidh
111 eachdrasa da sgriobhadh in seachdmadh la don 111111οὲ
Mhairt aon nihile se ced aondeg ceithre fithid dannaladh
ar ttighearna Iosa Criosd. ’ ’

Caillain Caimpbel leis 111 leis in leabharan .1. Caillain
niae Dhonchai mhic Dhughil mhic Chaillain oig. ff ⁴

The meaning of which is this:

EWAN MAG LEAN—By my hand was finished the ursi„
ting of this story the seventeenth day of the month of
March, one thousand six hundred ninety and one of the era
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Colin Campbell is the owner of this book, namely, Golia,
son of Duncan‚ son of Dougal, son of Colin the younger. ’
