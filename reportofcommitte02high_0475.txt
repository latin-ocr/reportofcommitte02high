GAELlc MANUSCRIPTS. 299

Lovely land is that eastern land,
Albion with all its lakes,
O that I might not depart from it !
But I depart with Naos.
Lovely is the tower of Fidga, and the tower of Fingal-
Lovely is the tower above them.
Lovely the isle of Drayno,
And lovely the tower of Suvno.
But, alas ! the wcod, the bay, which Ainle would
. approach, -
Are left by me ancl Naos for ever
Upon the coast of Albion.
O vale of Laith! would I were sleeping by its soothing
murmur !
F ish and venison, and the choice of the chace prepared,
Would be my repast in Glenlaith.
Glenmasain! high grow its herbs, fair wave its branches,
Steep would be the place of our repose
Over the grassy banks of Masan.
O vale of Ethai where a first house has been built forme,
Delightful were its groves, when the sun risen to his
Would strike his beams on Gleneiti. [height
How I long for the vale of Urchay Ξ
Straight vale of the fairest hills;
Joyful were his companions around Naos
In Glenurchay.
Vale of Daruadh!
Pleasant to me would be each of its people:
Sweet is the note of the cuckoo
From the bending tree of the mountain
Above Glen-da-Ruadh.
Lovely is Drayno of the sounding shore!
Lovely is Avich of the brightest sand!
O! that I might not depart from it west.
But Ι depart with my love !
