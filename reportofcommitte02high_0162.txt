'146 REPORT oN THE

natural choice of the poet, who pours his regrets
and sorrows in sounds which regret and sorrow in-
spire 3 the more artificial adaptation of found to the
sense, which seeks out words for the sake of their
sound, is perhaps oftener supposed tham intended,
even in the most cultivated poetry. Of this sort of

art in Gaelic poeti-y, Dr Srpith of Campbelton has ⁴

given a well chosen instance, in the poem of Der-
mid, (Gaelic Antiq. p. 193.) in two lines, descrip-
tive of different objects, the first of the hard, tough
spear of Deimid, the second of the soft and ssender

reed of Lego,

‘ Chagnadh e a shleagan readh madh
Mar chuile na leigc no mar iuachair.'

‘ He (the bear) grinds the tough red spear,
As if it were the soft reed or rusb of Lego.'

Though the Committee, as has been hinted at in ‚

the beginning of this Report‚ wished seduloussy to
avoid any thing like controversy on this subject, de-

firous rather of procuring evidence and information‚ ,

than of drawing inferences from them, yet it cannot
help, very shortly, taking notice of some difficulties

in this investigation‚ which have struck, and must ὲ
strike, every impartial person at all acquainted with ’
the subje&‚ and conversam at the same time with the ·

history of nations, or the progress of society.
