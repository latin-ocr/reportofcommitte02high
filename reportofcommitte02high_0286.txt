L1TERAL TRANsLm‘ioNfi -

She sent a message to Fraoch,
And the hero enquired what was her wisll'z

She r'eplied, that she could not be whole,-
Unless she got the full of her delicate hand,-
Of the fruit of that cold lake,

Pulled by no other· man than Fraoch.

“ Fruit was I never employed to gather,
'Said Fiach's son, with blushiug face;
llus though I have not hitherto, added Fraoch,
I will now go to pull fruit for Meyv.''

Fraoch departed with unpropitious steps,
And proceeded fo swirn on the lake:
,He found the monster fast asleep,
And its jaw open ‘eo the tree.

Fraoch, son of Fiach, of arms keen,
Came from the monster unobserved,
Carrying an arm-full of the red fruit
To' the place where Meyv was longing for it.

‘⁴ Though good be that which you have done,

Said lVIeyv of the whitest bosom,
Nought will relieve me, generous champion l
But a branch torn from the trunk.’'

F raoch, the youth who· knew not sear,
Went again to swim the soft lake ;

But he could not, how great soe’er his success,

Escape from his allotted death.
