POEMS oF oss1AN. '129

pliihments are very confideral:le3 but other men,
such as Clark and issi‘cfznedy„ whose stin-ies and omits
., of life were remote from the cultivation of poetry,

s who have either never written on any ohei occa-

slon, or whose writings give no token of poetical
“ genius or of powers of conipofition, produce to the
world poetry which, in i'ublimity and tenderness,
will, it is believed, be admitted to be at least equ-al
to the compositions of the best modern poete, and '
but little inferior to the most admired among the an-
cient. Setting afide all the credit due to persons of
unimpeached and respe&able characters, may it not
be aiked, how imposture and {orgery should become
muses to such men3 ssiould inspire them with the
ferimur, the pathos, and the imagery cont-:ned in
the compositione. which the-,v have [huo-given to the

world?
