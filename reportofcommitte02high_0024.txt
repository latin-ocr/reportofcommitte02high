Β REPORT oN THE

pose3 nothing less will so much as command the at.
tention of the public.

Becket tells me that he is to give us a new edi.
tion of your Differtation‚ accompanied with some
:remarks on Temora, Here is a favourable opportu->
nity for you to execute this purpose. You have a
just and laudable zeal for the credit of these poemS.
They are, if genuine, one of the greatest curiofities
{n all respefihz, that ever was discovered in the com-2
monwealth of letter83 and the child is, in a man-
ner, become yours by adoption, as Maepherson has
totally abandoned all care of it. These motives call⁸
upon you to exert yourself, and Ι think it were suit-
=able to your candour, and most satisfaCmry also to
the reader, to publish all the answqrs to all the let-2
1ch you write, even though some of these letters
should make somewhat against your own opinion in
this affair. We {hall always be the more affured
that no arguments are strained beyond their proper
force, and no contrary arguments fitppreffed‚ where
such an entire communication is made to us. Beck-
et joins me heartily in this application3 and he owns
to me, that the believers in the authenticity of the
poems diminish every day among the men of sense
and refleffion. Nothing less than what I propose
ean throw the balance on the other fide. I depart
from hence in about three weekS, and fflould be
glad. to hear your resolution before that time.¹
