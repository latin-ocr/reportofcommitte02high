DAUGHTER OF MEY. 109

Though pale with sear, she plunges 111 the ware,
And to the hero's hand a dagger gave :

Alas ! too late ; yet gath'ring all 'nis soree,
He drage», at last, his hissing foe to land.
Yet there the battle still grew worse and worse,
And long the conffiCt lasted on the strand.
At length he happily descry’d a part,
Just where the scaly neck and bre-ast did meet3
Through this he drove a well-directed dart,
And laid the monster breathless at his feet.
The lovers shouted when they saw him dead,
While from his 1111111(Α they cut the blecding head.

But soon the venom of his mortal bite
Within the hero’s bosom spreads like ssame3
His face grew pale, his strength forsook him quite,
And o’er his trembIIng limbs a numbness came.
Then sainting on the slimy shore hc fell,
And utter'd‚ with a heavy‚ dying gronn,
These tendet· words, ‘⁴ My lovely maid, farewell ἶ
Remember Albin; for his life is gone l '’
These sounds like thunder all her sense oppress,

And swooning down she fell upon his breast.

At last, the maid awak’ning as from sleep,
Felt all her soul o'erwhelm’d in deep despair,
Her eyes star’d wild, she rav’d, she could not weep,
She beat her bosom, and she tore her hair !
She look'd now on the ground, now on the skies,
Now gaz’d around, like one imploring aid. ’
But none was near in pity to ‘ner eries,
No comfort came to soothe the hapless maid Σ
Then grasping in her palm, that shone like snm-,3
The youth’s dead hand, she thus expres'd her woe.
