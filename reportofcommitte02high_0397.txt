As their swords were subduing the mighty.

My father was driving the battle Α

Where it pressed the most3

Nor from him did bodily form retire unmaimed⁶
In the light of his steps I strove to follow³

But frail is my strength ‘to-night

Many the limbs which keen-edged swords did mangle,
When the valiant of. the people‚ pressed by strokes,
Sunk on the sward, never more to asise.
