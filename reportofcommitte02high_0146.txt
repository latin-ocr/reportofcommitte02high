Mr Maepherson's executor, containing the engage-
ment of Fingal with the Spirit of Loda‚ in the poem

‘ The Committee subjoins the paffages in the ori-
ginal Gaelic, which it has analized, with a rigidly
literal transsation into English, and annexes the trans-

its opinion, which it thus puts in the Society's power
to reje& or to confirm, that, in the original, the
scene and its circumstances are given distinffly ; they
are embodied in clear and accurate description ; that
in the transsation by Mr Macpherson they are fre-
quently lost in words, of which the found pleases
the ear, but which are of a general, indeterminate
sort, that might belong to any other place or obje&
of a similar kind.
