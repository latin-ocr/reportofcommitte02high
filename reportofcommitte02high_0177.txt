LETTERS TO DR. BLAIR. ἶ)

ἰι this country to be present when this trial is made ; but
I believe I can entmst it to people who will execute it very
ἶ faithfujly. I am sorry I 'nave so little leisure to write to
2 . you at present : this will serve only to tell you how little l
k can do. I wish heartily it were in my power to do more.
,Γ -If any thing occurs to rne to be done, before l leave the
country, I will acquaint you3 at any rate, Iwffl trouble
you with another letter when I have con-verset} with people
’ who can give some assistance in the i.1vestigation.
I perceived this scepticism beginning long ago, aud fore-
saw the difficulty of answering it. ΜΓ Hunie certainly
sees the con eluence of it to the reputation of the poem
'- in 3 very right light ; and it must give great pleasure to any
one connected with this country, to obviate this evil3 but
I hav-e great doubt of such evidences being procured, as
, the case requires. Though I can do little, nothing shall be
to fight Ossian’s cause, that lies in the power of,
Dear Sir,

Your most obedient,

3. From Doctor JOHN MACPHERSONJ Minister of Sleat‚
dated Sleat, i-ith October 1763.

DEAR Sm, ἡ
YOUR letter of September eeth came to

hand four days ago. Before l speak to the cometus, you
’ will permit me to say, however little that declaration may
signify, that not any one in this part of the world can have
more sensible pleasure in doing a thing that can afford Dr
ν Blair any degree of satisfaction. The testimonies I had of
his benevolence, when last in Edinburgh‚ give him an un-
* doubted right to all the small services in my power.
