“ Gaul strong and brave,
Tnink of valour,
Hand of bounty and ofmight,
Fit example for greatness.
Champion swift and powerful
To wound a multitude of enemies,
A wave that rolls in strength,
Is Gaul in the field of strife3
A heath that is ready to burn,
Is the hero in the full confli&.
The course of the kingly warrior·
Is as the full darting meteor.
Champion chearful and full of ειᾶἰοη,

Live1y‚ eloquent, and mufical.
Though dealing wounds, steady in friendshsp,
Perfaemning feats of prowess, and gaining many vifiories?
