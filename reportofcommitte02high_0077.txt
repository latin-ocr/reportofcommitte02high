POEMS 012 ossiAN. 61

This publication by Dr Smith, if not impeachecl
in its authenticity, your Committee cannot but re-
gard as very strong evidence in the question submit-
ted to its confideration and inquiry3 since, in the
poems published by him, are to be found not only
the same strain of high and impaffioned poetry, but
also the same delicacy and refinement of sentiment
and feeling, which form so extraordinary a feature
in the poems transsated by ΜΓ Macpherson. Of
some passages os one of those poems, ⁶ the Death of
Gaul,’ the Committee will give a literal transsation,
which they think inferior to none of those given by
Maepherson, either in sublimity or tenderness. The
transsation is given line for line of the original,
which, to enable the Gaelic reader to judge of the
fidelity with which it is rendered, is inserted in tho
Appendix, ΝΟ. 14. The argument of the poem is
shortly this: Fingal summoned his heroes sor an ex-
pedition to the Isse of [frona. A flood in the river
Strumon prevented Gaul srom joining them in time 3

= but he embarked in his ship alone on the'succeeding

day. On his voyage, however, he paffed his friends,
who were returning with victory, unperceived‚ and
landed fingly on the hostile shore. According to
the chivalrous idea of those times, he would not fly,
but struck hisshield as a token of defiance to the
issanders, against whom he singly maintained a des-
perate consuet, till, fearful of a near approach, they
rolled a stone from above, which striking his thigh,
disabled him from moving‚ and there he was left by
his enemies, dastardly alike and cruel, to pine and

die.
