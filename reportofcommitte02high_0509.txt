TRANSLATIONY

The hos'ffi offered an advice

To the great Manos of successful ships,

To trace back their way upon ocean,

To meet the chiefs of the host of Inisphail.

So the heroes returned by their* fifties fieree,

And lond was their noise on the strand.

Like 3 roaring wave each band advanced*

Fingal immediately dispatched 3 messenger

To Manos of the victorious pursuits and exploits:

‘4 Where are thy solemn oaths‚

Thou man that upholdest saith but with thy left hand ἓ

Fierce and furious an-swered the chief,
With the wonted frown of his wrath‚
{SI left them on the dew of the grass,
