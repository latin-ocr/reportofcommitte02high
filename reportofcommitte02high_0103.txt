produce the book which Mr Maepherson seemed de-

’ firous to confign to oblivion. Having arraigned

Macpherson at the bar of the public, as one of the
first literary impostors in modern timeS‚ I have im-
posed an opposite obligation on his friends to vindi-
cate *and rescue his memor-y, if they can, from the
imputation of forgery ; after which no reason can
be affigned for withholding the book, but that it
would serve for his convic‘tion. Such ivs the plain
state of the fa& ; and if his friends are not at liberty
to produce the book, the only circumstance that
could suppose an obligation to suppress it, is, -t'hat it
would serve for his detefflon. Very possibly it con-
tains-nothing *to the purpose3 but the book would
have been produced long ago, had it afforded a sm-
gle proof of the authenticity of Offian ; and, in the
impartial publications of the Highland Society‚ no
part of the evidence should appear to be suppreffed.

1 do not mean by this, that the book itself should
be pubfflhed, but that it should be transmitted to the
Highland Society for public inspeffion3 otherwise
Ι must conclude that a part of the evidence, the most
injurious to Maepherson‚ has been avithheld by his
friends. 1 am, my Lord, with respe& and esteem,
your Lordship’s most obedienst humble servam,
