monly the case ; though in this,· as in¹ other instances where
such an opportunity of comparison occurs, the simplicity antl-
'distinctness of narrative in the original ancient poem will be
easily contrasted with the general and more ornamented ex-
pression of Maepherson’s translation. In the dean of Lis-
more's MS. a different reading explains one passage which
vpuzzled Miss Broolze·. Her¹ originalis,

“ Inghian righ so tuinn,’'

‘⁶ Daughter os the king under waves ;”

which she says, “ she did not translate literally, as it was.
difficult to know what turn' to give it.⁷’ But in the dean of
Lismore’s MS. and in Kennedy’s copy, it standsj

“ Inghean righ tir fo thuinn,”
‘⁶ Daughter of the king of the wave-surrounded land ;”

os which the meaning is sufficiently obvious. Δ ,

The catastrophe of the-j‘ffiem in Miss Brooke, different
from that of the similar story in Maepherson, where the,
lady is killed by a shaft from the bow of her pursuer‚ and
F ingal himself revenges her death, by slaying the ferocious
Bor-bar, (as Maepherson calls M oirc· bor-b) is nearly the same·>
as in Kennedy's edition: it includes the sall of Moire borb4
killed by Gaul aster a sev ere conflict3 the placing of a gold
ling on eacli oshis fingers aster his death, the Maid of Craca

sojourning a year with Finga13 and Gaul remaining six
months, getting his woundscured3 under the care os that
generous and hospitable king. This last circumstance os
Gaul’s cure is not in Kennedy‚ but is found in some other
<editions os the poem, in the Committee’s possession. Fin-
gal’s celebrity as a phy sician is indeed a favourite topic iri
many of the meient tales and poems3 to his magical cup
in particular, are ascribed many wonderful medicinal⁷ virtues.
