tract made from Fol. XIII. rev. col. 2. is inserted. plate 3.
No. 3.

Luidh iaromh Columb cille fecht ann gu Ri Cruithnech
.1. gxi Bfuidhi Mac milcon, agiis do flunadh dorus in
dunaigh fris, agus do foscuil fo chedoir glaisiaxnuidhi an
baili tre urnaidhthi Cholumb Chille. Tainic iar sin Mac
in righ ..1 Maelcu agus a Drui do frithtagra fri Columb
Cille tre geinn tlighecht.

The English is as follows:

After' this St. Columba went upon a time to the King·
of the Picts‚ 11ame1y‚ Bruidhi son of Milchu‚ and the gam
of iffthe castle was shut against him, but the iron locks of
the town opened inrstantly through'the prayers of Columb
Cille. Then came the Son of the King, to wit, Maelchu
and his Druz'd to argue keenly against columb Cille iu
support of Paganism.

A form of letter somewhat ruder, and seemingly later
by about a century than the foregoing, marks the last
piece* in the volume, which is a tale much effaced. It
should seem from the following passage of it exhibited
plate 3. No. 1. that the isles of Innsehorc, so frequently
mentioned in our ancient poems, were considered by the
author of it as facing Scythia3 which makes it probable
that Shetland and Orkney were included in the name,
though the modern reciters of tales and poems usually
consider it as applying only to the latter.
