70 REPORT oN THE Δ

Mackenzie, which, in justice to Mr Μι Diarmid, as ⁷

well as to Dr Smith‚ the Committee thinks it pm
per to lay bef01e the Society.

‘ δικ,

⁶ On the other page my father- has sent a
copy of Offian's Addreffes to the Sun. The Bed of
Gaul, Mr M'·Farlane‚ from whom my father had it,
got from a person in Argylesbire‚ who had heard it
in his youth. Neither ΜΓ M‘Farlane nor my fa-
ther suspe&ed its being already in print ; but, a few
days ago, on look-ing over the poems publissmd by
Dr Smith of Campbeltown, my father observed it
at the conclufion of the poem immed ⁶ Tiomnah
Glmil? T his mistake I hope you will have the good-
ness to excuse, as it arose merely from ignorance of
what Dr Smith had done. ’ Mr M‘Farlane's finding
it by a different channe} from Dr Smith, you will
no doubt look upon as a proof of its authenticity?

From the same gendeman, the Reverend Mr
M‘Diarmid‚ the Committee received two celebrated
paffages of poems published by Mr Macpherson:

Offian's Address to the Sun in Carthon, and a fimi-‘

lar Address in Cari-ickthzcra. The originals of those

two poems will also be found in the Appendix, .
Pages 135, & 187. The letter from Mr M‘Diarmid ·
