The design of the Farmers Magazine is to collect and
disseminate ingenious Theories, important and well au.-
thenticated F acts, and accurate Experiments, which relate
to the different branches of Rural Economy. It must be
well known to every person in the least acquainted with
the different parts of the United Kingdmn, that discoveries
and improvements, particularly in Agriculture⁷ travel very
slowly. To remedy this, the Farmers Magazine was firezt
projected3 and the Proprietors are happy to say, that, if
they may judge from the almost unprecedented sale of
more than 4000 copies of each Number‚ the object of this
publication is in a great degree answered. The work, in
its plau and arrangement, is well calculated for the end
the Proprietors had in view3 it consists of--1- Miscella-
neous Communications‚ chiefly of the most important prac-
tical nature—2. The Review of Agricultuial Publications.
-3. Agricultura} Intelligence from almost everxry district
in scotland, and from several in England. The utility
and importance of this branch must be evident to 'every
practical Fanner, who, at the moderate price of Two Shil-
lings a quartos, may leam the state of the crops, and the
price of grain, cattle, διο. in the different parts of the
kingdom, besides being enabled to compare his own prac-
tice with that in other districts, and thus to correct what iq

improper pr deficient.
