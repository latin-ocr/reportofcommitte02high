COPY 01³ ANOTHER LETTER FROM THE SAME‘ TO
THE SAME.

MY DEAR 3113,

Ι am very glad you have undertak-
en the task which I used the freedom to recommend
to you. Nothing less than what you propose will
serve the purpose. You need expe& no affistance
from Macpherson, who flew into a paffion when Ι
told him of the letter 1 had wrote to you : But you
must not mind so strangev and heteroclite a mortal‚
than whom I have scarce ever known a man more
perverse and unamiahle. He will probably depart
for Florida with Governor Johnstone‚ and I would
advise him to travel among the Chickisaws or Che-
rokees, in order to tame him and civilize him.

· Ι should be much pleased to hear of the success of
your labours. Your method of direffing to me is
under cover to the Earl of Herfford, Northumber-
land House. Any letters that come to me under
that direffion, will be sent over to me at Paris.

I have no present thoughts of publishing the work
you mention 3 but when I do, Ι hope you have no
Objection of my dedicating it to you.

I beg my compliments to Robertson and Jardine.
I am very sorry to hear of the state of Ferguffon's
health. John Home went to the country yesterday
with Lord Bute. I was introduced the other day to

that
