tion, of collecting the best that remained. Mr Pope’s
own account of this proposed undertaking will be
found in a letter to Dr mair, contained in the Ap-
pendix, ΝΟ. 3.

time, was the celebrated James Macphers0n‚ whose
transsations first attracted, in any eminent degree,

quainted with the circumstances, the authority of
whose relation will readily be acknowledged by the

The Reverend Dr mair,

† Dr Adam Ferguson,
