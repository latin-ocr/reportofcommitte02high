66 The next poem 13 311 account of the Death of Bran,
66. Fingal's celebrated (108; ·” on which it 13 sufficient to re-
,mark⁹ that, close by one of the ancient ruins in Glenlyon,
described by Mr. Hill, as already mentioned, there is 311
'creet stone, called Conabhacan‚ or the Dog-stake‚ to which
Bran, according to the tradition οΓ the neighbourhood, used
to be bound. , ,.

,, ,Traditions οΓ this kind, it is true, are not 1100111131· to
Scossssmd, but common to it with Ireland3 where the scenesi
ι(1Γ Fingal's hunting adventures are still pointed ont. But
they prove the fallacy of Mr.Hi11's 015301ν3ῒ1011, that 66 the
66 songs 1110111301( 03 mention οηζγ Erin, or Ireland, its pecu-
66 liarities and traditions. ’' Especially, as the two 301183
last named make no mention either of Ireland, 01· οΓ Scot-
land3 and of the other five, which 110 1133 Ρ111)113110(1, there
are but four that mention Irelaml, and one of these, which
Δ mentions both countries, agrees with the fifth, which men-2
tions Scotland alone, in representing the latter as the proper
land of the Fine 3113113 ,

Mr. Hill’s sre ror appears to hav re proceeded in Ρ311,1 from
an impression which was malde upon· him by the first verse
of the translation of the ‚poem xx luch 1013103 the Death of
03031. 6 Ι am very sad after thee, 0113011102311100 those
66 who were my contemnoraries 310 departed.1 am filled
66 with grief, sorrow, and pain, since my foster-brother 13
66 80110 Γο0111 1110. ” On which 110 remarks m a note, 66 The
ι. ‘⁶ 111 11113ῖο connection οΓ fosterage here so strongly express-
“ 0(1, 13 111 3 great degree p'eculiar to Irela1'1d,and seems

, 66 strono ly to point out the origin 01 this 30118 1, ”
g Now it 13 certain that the intimate connection οΓ fosterage

is no more peculias to Ireland, considered in comparison
with Scotlcmdz, than sadness after friends and departed con-
.ten11)oraiies is peculias to it3 as Mr. Hiu might have
