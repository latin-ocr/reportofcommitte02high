LETTERS το MR. MACKENZOE, &a oo

stioned on that subject, he said that he had in his possession
several pieces of antient poetry. When ΜΓ Home desired
to see thern, ΜΓ Macpherson asked if he understood the
Gaelic ? “ Not one word.'' “ Then, how can I show you
them ?'’ “ Very easily‚” said ΜΓ Home ; ‘⁴ translate one of
the poems which you think a good one, and I imagine that
Ishall be able to form some opinion of the genius and cha-
racter of the Gaelic poetry.'’ ΜΓ Maepherson declined the
task, saying, that his translation would give a very imper-
fect idea of the original. ΜΓ Home, with some difficulty,
persuaded him to try, and in a day or two he brought him
the poem on the death of Oscar3 with which ΜΓ Home
was so much pleased, that in a few days two or three more
were brought him, which Mr Home carried to Edfflburgh,
and shewed them to Dr Blair, Dr Fergusson, Dr Robertson,
and Lord Elibank, who were no less pleased with them than
he had been. In the course of the year, Mr Home carried
the translations which ΜΓ Maepherson had given him to
London, where they were equally admired.

If Mr Home had been possessed of the second sight,
and could have foreseen that the authenticity of the poems
,of Ossian would have ever been called in question, he
might certainly have preserved a more distinct and accurate
account of the manner in which they were brought to light.

v It is perhaps unnecessary to mention a circumstance which
is probably known to many gentlemen of the Highland
Society. ΜΓ Home, in travelling through the Highlands,
has met with several common people who repeated to him

μ many hundred lines of the rhymes, as they called them.
Mr Home having usually with him one or more who un-

derstood the Gaelic language, made the rhymes be repeat-
ed again, which the person who understood both languages
translated, so as to leave no room to doubt that the tales

’ aud songs, sung by the boatmen and herds in the High.

lands, are the „poenis of Ossian.
