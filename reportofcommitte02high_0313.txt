ομ MR. H1LL’s SPECIMEN. ⁸ 141

⁶³ In this letter, (says Mr.- Hss-l), Mae Nab seems w„
‘⁶ imply that the Fingalians divided their time between
‘⁰ Ire1and and scotland31 th'ongh the songs themselves
⁸ mention only Erin oi· Ireland, its peculiari-ties and tradi-
⁶⁴ tions‘. The following Song‚ called Ossian’s Prcgyers,
⁸² which· indeed is in many respects the most curiouseof any,
⁴¹⁴ is also the only one he gave me that mentions Scotland
⁶⁶ or Allabinn. He, however, related to me the history of
‘⁶ another song; a copy of which has been published by*
“ Smith in his Gaelic Antiquities, under the title of T he
‘⁴ Fall qs Tura; likewise mentioning Scossand, ancl con-
“ taining some other remarkable particularsss.’'

Now it is certain, that not only thev general tradition, but

likewise the ancient poetry of the Highlands, as publrished.

by ΜΓ. Hill himself, represents the Fingalians as residing
in scotland, and going thence to hunt in Ireland3 and thae‘
they also make repeated ment-ion of the peculiarities and

, traditions of the former kingdom. It is farther certain,-

that Crom-ghleann nan clach is mentioned in the Gaelic
poems as a residence of Finga13 ancl that the reciters of

>them allege it to be Glenlyon in Perthshire‚ where a round

building formed of huge stones without mortar or cement,
is still known by the name of Tigh Chrom-ghlinn nan

, clach. But let us attend to what Mr. Hin himself says up-

on this head.
‘⁶ Glenlyon‚ which Mac Nab in his letter speaks of‘aff
‘⁶ one of the principal abodes of the Fingalians, lies in the

3 ‘9 western part of Perthshire‚ on the borders of Argyle-

³ 4⁶1 shire, near Loch Tay·

‘⁶ Throughout this country are many ruins of rude stone

ς “ walls, constructed in a circle3 the stones of which are
'⁵ ‘⁶ very large: theSe are said by tradition to be the work of
