Ἴ POEMS OF OSSIAN. 143

The same measure will be found in the original of
another war-song, communicated to the Committee„
from memory, by its correspondent the Reverend

⁴ Mr Gallie, in his letter of 4th March 1801, taken, ·

into this Report, p. 39. That war-song or odeq
with a literal transsation, is as follows ε

‘ A mhacain cheann
Nan cursan strann
Ard leumnach righ na’n sseagh,
Lamh thre-in 'sgueh cais
Croidhe ard gun scz'z
Ceann airm nan rinn gear goim
Geam· fios gu bas
Gun bharc {heol bz‘m
’ Bhi snamh ma dhubh Innishtorq

Mar tharnanech bhaoil
Do bhuill a laoich
Do shuil mar chaoir ad cheam:
Mar charaic chruin
Do chroidhe gun roinn
Mar lassam oidhch do lanu
Cum suar do scia
Is crobbhui nial
Mar chih bho reul a bhaith
A mhacain che-ann

¹ Non cursem strann
Sgrios naimhde fios gu lar!

⁴ Offspring of the chiefs
Of snorting‚ high—bouuding steeds!
King of spem-s !
Strong arm in every trial ;
Ambitious heart without dismay 5
