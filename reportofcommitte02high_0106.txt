90 REPORT oN THE

The MSS, which the Committee obtained from the

other correspondents above alluded to, were various
copies or editions (as they may be called) of the
poems of Offian, or poems in imitation of Offian,
now in most common circulation in the Highlands.
They were chiefly collected in the Western High-
lands and issandS‚ and frequently appeared to be the
same poemS‚ but in some of the copies with consi-
derable variations‚ and what appeared to be corrup-
tions, with those current in Ireland ; some of which
Miss Brooke, the lady herein before mentioned,
published, with a metrical transsation. A good
many pieces, seemingly of a purer sort, though al-
ways with a mixture of rude, and sometimes unin-
telligible paffages‚ were sent to the Society by Mr
M‘Laggan‚ minister of Blair in Athole‚ Sir George
Mackenzie of Coull, and Sir J. Sinclair‚ Barts„;
the Reverend Mr Sage of Kildonnan, in Sutherland‚
Mr M‘Donald of Staffa‚ General M‘Kay, Archi-
bald Fletcher ’¹¹‘ in Achalladar, Glenomhy, Mr Peter
M‘Farlane of Perth, the Reverend Mr Malcolm
M‘Donald in Tarbert of Cantyre‚ Captain M‘Donald
of Brackish, and the Reverend Mr Stewart‚ minister
of Craignish.

Major M‘Lachlan of Kilbride‚ on the applica-
tion of one of the Committee (Lord Bannatyne),
was so obliging as to communicate part of a very

large collection of MSS. made by an ancestor of his, .

chiefly

θ’ Fletcher was hhnselfthe semer, and from his recitation, a·
lle could not write them, the poems which he sent to the chletjf
wele taken down. (Wde his affidavit, App. Ne, 15.)
