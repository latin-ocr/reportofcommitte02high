by Mr M‘Diarmid‚ the Committee subjoins here, with
Maepherson’s transsation of the same passages at the

⁶ Inclosed you have a transsation of the Gaelic
pieces which I sent you last week. It is as literal as
poffible. Imade it so on purpose, without any re-
gal-d to the English idiom, that you might under-
stand the original the better. Every one knows at
what disadvantage a transsation of this kind must ap-
pear, from one language into another, but more
especially when {he idioms and genius of the two
languages differ so widely as those of the Gaelic and
English. As l have not a copy of ΜΓ ΜῆερῑιεῑῐοΠἜ
transsation by me, Icould not compare it with the
original, nor point out wherein he has departed from
’ it3 Mr Mackenzie will eafily see that, by compar-
ing his transsation with mine. I got the copy of these
pomus, about thirty years ago, from an old man in Glen-
· lyon. Itook it, and several other fragments, now
I sear irrecoverably lost, from the man's mouths
He had learnt them in his youth, from people in the
same‘glffl, which must have been long before Mac-
pherson was born. Ι had at one time a considerable
number of old poems, some of them part of what
Maepherson has transsated3 but by lending them
from baad to hand, I cannot now poffibly trace
E 4 them
