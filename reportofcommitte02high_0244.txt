72 ' LETTERS To MR. MAcKEsz,

The retinement of manners in Ossian’s poems is, as you
observe, a well known objection against this authenticity,
But let our history be investigated‚ and I am satisfied this
objection will be done away. What if we shall produce
passages purely historical‚ and undeniably more than 1000
years old, that are no less refined and delicate? Take the
first instance that occurs to my memory, and I think it
would not disgrace even the man qffirling in the isth
century :—-“ See that cranc coming towards our shore, in
its ssight over from Ireland. It is quite spent, and obliged
to alight in the water. Run, take up the poor bird, bring
it to the house, fecd it, and take care of it for three days,
till it be sufficiently refreshed, and able to return to its na-
tive land3 and for thy kindness and hospitalizy‚ my son,
God will blcss thee.’-' I quote from memory, and do not
pretend to have the exact rendering of the words, but I arn
sure I have the exact rendering of the sentiment. Investiff
gate our history, and it will give credibility to our poetry,
in more respects than in delicacy of ‘sentimenn We have
but lately emerged from a long night of barbarisxn3 but
previous to that· night, there existed, as there is much rea-
son to believe, a period of considerable light and resine-
ment. Ι have made some efforts² not as yet very succes&
fully, tc penetrate the darkness in which Highland history
is involved. I hope more will be done by those who have
more opportunity3 and that the Highland Society wiss εἴα,
tend to the ancient history, as well as to. the ancient Ροεῖιγ,Α
of the Highlassdse I am, with respect and esteem,

Sir>
Your most humble servant,
JOHN SMITHf
