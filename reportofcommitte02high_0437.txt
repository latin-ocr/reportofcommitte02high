ΙΙ. STOIRM agrees {n meaning wssth the German sturm,
and the Dutch and English stxm, which Minsheu in his
Etymological Dictionary, derives fro n the Latin sterno.
Had that learned author been acgua'nzzd with the Celtic,
he would have found a happier etymon in smirne, which is
itself derived from toirm, a lond murmuring noise.

The affinity which a number of Teutonic words bear to
the Celtic is, in part, a natural ant} necessary consequence
of the first peopling of Europe, and the near neighbourhood
of the Celtic and Teutonic nations in ancient times.

Of the several races of men by which Europe is inhabit-
ed, it is certain that the Celtic people were the first who
moved westward from Asia, the region to which the uni-
form evidence of history, whether sacred or profane, refers
as the original seat of mankind. For Herodotus, the oldest
historian of Europe now extant, has remarked repeatedly
(Euterpe, C. 33. Melpom. C. 40), that the Celtae
were possessed, in his time, of the extreme westerly
point of the European continent. That they formed settle-
ments in the countries whiclr they passed in the course of
their migration from east ts] wssss, we may judge by the
traces which they leit of their name; Strabo having re-
marked (Lib. XI.) that the ol-L· writers of Greece called all
the northern nations (meaning those of Asia and Europe
alike) by the name of Scythians and Celto-Scythians, and
Pliny having given us to understand (L. VI. c. 13.) that
the Lytarrnis promontory, which is supposed to be the
Cape of Oby *, now regarded as the extreme boundary of
