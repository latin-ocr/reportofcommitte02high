” Μ possession of Fingal and his Heroes? Iprefer them to
Μ thy God, and thee, O Patrickffl So Purchas relatesfi¹
that, when the Spaniards attempted to convert the in,-
habitants of the Philippine Isles to Christianity3 the
islanders replicd, that they would rather be in hell with
:their forefathers, than in heaven with the Spaniards.

According to M⁴Nab‚ Fingal seems to have been the
Odin of the Scots: for he said, they had no religion, prior
to Christianity‚ but the reverence of Fingal and his race.
ι This account agrees with the entire deficiency of religious
‚ ideas, in the Ossian of Maepherson and Smith,; and with
,the opinions and prejudices expressed in the following
s Poem.

The Urnigh Ossian evidently appearS, even through the
«medium of the following rude translation, to be superior in
poetic merit to any of ‘theSongs which accompany it. I
am very sorry the translation is not entire. The first twen-
‘tty-one yerses, and the last verse, or thirty-sixth‚ were trans-
aelated for me at Oban in Argyleshire, by a schoolmaster
there; who was procured by Mr. Hugh Stephenson‚ inn-
keeper at Oban. The remainder of the translation was
sent me from Edissbm'gh2 in consequence ofDr. VVillan's
application.
