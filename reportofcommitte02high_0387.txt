4 The choicest son of Erin's king.

I desire the submission of Erin,

Or a shower that wounds shall shed around her.
Though a flood of tears should flow

From the eyelids of high-born virgins3
Though showers of blood

Should drop from star-bright eyes 3

‘The mourning cry of all her women
Would be heard as the screaming of sea-fowl on the shore.”

‘⁶ Often have mighty heroes demanded,

¹. That Erin's yielded pledge should be sent over sea,
⁴ But never was it, nor ever shall it be granted.

Let the shell go round to us,
Let joy bearn in each warrior-'s countenance.
Ἴ O Bards! raise the strains on high. -
Let the people hear the sound of your gladness.
, Let rocks and vales at once resound
To the joint melody of voices and instruments ³4.
And so let us pass the night
Till morning shine with brightest ray.
Loud was the noise along the beach.
As the sound of a wave was [the moving of] each tribe,
’ Like the rustling of a flock of seafowl to the shore.
[Their sound]'was like a thousand streams

son of Semo. ‘⁵ But, Carril, raise the voice on high3 tell
the deeds of other times. Sencl thou the night away in song3
and give the joy of grief.” lb. p. 236, 238.

The sound spreads wide. The heroes rise, like the
, breaking of a blue-rolling wave.—They rose rustling like
’ a flock of sea-fowl, when the waves expel them from the
shore. Their sound was like a thousand streams that meet
