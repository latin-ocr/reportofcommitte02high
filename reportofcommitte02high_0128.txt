But the heavy nate of grief constantly sotmding;
The mustea] cruit θ’* of the sweetest strain

Will not awake my heart to joy.

My mind is sunk into the depth of waves,

Hollow mmmm-ing, without repose or quiet ;
While I bear constantly in mind thy manners.
Oh ἔ my arrow-wound of grief without cure!

No more {hall Ι hear thy conversation,
Sweetet· than the mufic of bards5
Or¹the thrush in the lonely vales ;
Which has left my heart for ever sad.

'No more {hall thy countenance be seen

To brighton in the tower of Connal.

Alas ἱ Ι am fallen under a flood of sorrow :
When, my love ! shall light bearn on thee Ξ

Dark is thy dwelh'ng under the sod,
Nam-ow and frozen-is thy bare bed ;

Never will the morning shine

That shall wake my love from his ssumber ξ’
