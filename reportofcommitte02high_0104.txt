88 REPoRT ON THE

‘ ΕΓΒ, Killihuntly‚ SOth May, 1802.

‘ I have to apologize forv having delayed so
long to answer your favour of the llth of April,
respeffing ΜΓ Laing's application sor the manuscript
poems of the late ΜΓ James Macphersom in my pos-
seffion3 but circumstances not necessary to mention
put it out of my powei‘to make the proper rcply to
you sooner.

From principle, and from inclination‚ I am a
friend to truth‚ and to liberal and ingenious inqui-
ry; and, so far from Nhaving any wilh to withhold
information from Mr Lairg on this subject, I should
willingly aid him in his researches, were it in my
power to do so, whilst he investigates the question
with the learning of a scholar, and the candour of a
gentleman. Without wilbing to take any share in
a subject of disputc on which Ι have long formed a
decided opinion for myself, Ι transmit you the ma-
nuscript by my young friend Mr George Macpher-
son, Inveressiie‚ to be used as you please. I believe
it can throw no light on the subjc&; but you can
best judgc whether it is proper to be communicated
to Mr Laing or otherwise. Had it been either given
to me confidentially‚ or come into my hands as one
os ΜΓ Macpherson’s executorS, it should never have
been produced by me3 butI leel no reluctance in
giving it up to you, as accident alone put it in my
possession, many years before I had any acquaint-

ance
