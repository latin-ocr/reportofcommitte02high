34 LETTERS To DR. BLAt'R.

that people in South Britain, and the Teufones from Scanae
dinavia3 50 that, as the Celtic nations on the continent,
who were in perpetual motion, some one way or other»,
were coming in frequent detachments to the British Isles, it ,
15 likely the leaders of tribes, and the other better sort of 'f
people, would have known something of the use of cloaths ¹
in Ossian's time. But the lower classes, Ι mean those ι
who were inferior 111 valour, or servile mechanics, if they
had other than smiths Iknow not, would have only worn the Ϊ
sagum, like Luno. Sagum‚ Iam informed by two clas-
sical writers, is a Galuic word, which is no other than

any square 10050 covering‚ made use of by the military

whom Aldo was originally (1050οη11011, to be the Titanesffj
or Teutoncs; for our European forefathers flattered their. Ἰ
vanity very much in deriving their origin from some οἱ*
their favourite (1011105, as the Germans pretended to have&
descended of Tuiston, by his son Mannus. I am gurd}¹¹
this genealogy of Aldo hath the character of high antiqui-r]
ty, higher than the general belief of the christian systems'f .
in 11115 country. Enough of this dry stuff. “
