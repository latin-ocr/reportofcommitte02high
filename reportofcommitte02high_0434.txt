any one who is tolerably versant in the history of ancient
Italy.-—-The Umbri whom Pliny (Lib. III. c. 14.) and
Florus (Lib. Ι. C. ΓΙ.) consider as the most ancient people
of Italy, are expressly declared to have sprung from the old
i Gauls‚ by Solinus (Cap. IL), and by Servius (ad AEneid.
XII.)*; the former appealing to the authority of Bocchus,
and the latter relying on hlarcus Antonius’ evidence. And,
