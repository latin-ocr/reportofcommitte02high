He said, and rage in tickling poison ran

Thro’ ev’ry soul, and stung each gen’rous man.
The hunter heard, rage sparkled fromhis eyes,
And from his inmost soul the hero sighs‚

Then thus indignant spoke, Ah! glory gone?
Ah antient virtue, now for ever flown !

What blessed corner does thy godhead rest?
No more you swell the gen'rous Scottish breast.
When thus, O scotland, Saxons dare deride,

T hy steel-clad warriors ranged side by side.

1 can no more; my panting vitals swell,

I’ll give thee glory‚ or thy soul to hell.

Then tow’rds the foev the youth indignant moves„
Fear trembles‚ en'mies praise, and envy loves.
He strides along the men-inviron’d ground,

His rattling arms emit an iron sound.

The, saxon saw, advanc’d‚ nor look'd behind,
Fate hurried on, and courage steel‘d his mind;
Bright in effulgent arms the youths appear’d,
Each o'er the plain a steely column rear'd,
They rush together, clashing arms afar

Reflect the horrors of the dismal war3

Awful the blades wave gleaming- in the sky,
And from the crashing steel the sparkles flyi—
They sight, and wearied cease, and fight again,
Their feet bake dust with blood upon the plain.
Death undetermin'd‚ points to each his sfings,
And conquest ssutters round on dubious wings.
The hill-born youth reminds with anxious care,

” What vaunts the foul-mouth'd Saxon breath⁷d on air.

His country’s love the youthful hero warms,
And vengeance strung his almost wearied arms,
Uprais'd alost the li ght-reflexive made,

Sings thro' the air, and cleaves the Saxon head,
