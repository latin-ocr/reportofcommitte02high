mad cm Torc nimhe‚' the Death of Dermid 3- ‘ Mar*

Mharbhadh Bran‚’ the Death of Bran ; and ‘ Urnigh
Ossian: Offian’s Prayer3 of which, having procur-

ed transsations from a gentleman in the neighbour-
hood, Mr Hill published these transsations, with the
original

{nstead of

‘ I can hardly believe thy talc, thou clerk with thy white book,
that Fingal, or any so generous as he, should be iu captivity ei·-
ther to God or man.' On which Mr Hill inquire& in a note,
‘ Why was light hair esteemed an opprobrium ? the Erse them·

³ Nois tha deireadh air tois
&cuir do d' chaois ashean fhirle,’

:s rendered in ’ΜΓ Hffi's pnmphlet,

‘ Now the 121st thing3 are become first3 change thou therefore
why ways, old man with the grey locks.’ Now there is no such
word in the Gaelic as chaois 3 the couplet [hould be written thus,
as in other copies of the poem :

‘ Nois tha deire ar taois
Scuir dod bhacis a shean f hir leith.’

man! But upon the foregoing mistake of the transcriber, and
want of knowledge in the transsator, Μι- Hill founds a charge of
plagiarism from the scripture-„1 passage in St Matthew‚ chap. 20.
⁷ verse 16. ‘ So the last {hall be first, and the first last 3 for many

ere called, but few chosen?
