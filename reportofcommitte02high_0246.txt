ἾἸ· LETTERS TO MR. MACKENZIE.

became a student in philosophy, when, in the year 176&
or 1767, I read Mr Maepherson’s translation, with which,

beautiful as it is, Ι was by no means so much charmed as- ·

I had been with the oral recitation of such as I had heard
of the poems in the original language. The elegance οξ
the modern dress did not therefore, in my opinion, com.-
pensate for the loss of the venerable and ancient garb. In
reading· the translation, I recognized a number of poenis, ’
episodes, and passages, which were familiar to me. Some
of the poenos, and parts of poems, were, however, new
to me; and others which Ι knew, and supposed to have
considerable merit, Ι desiderated. Of a number of these
last, Ι procured several editions some years afterwards;
but did not trouble myself or others with collecting those
which had been already translated, as it was then expected
- that Mr Macpherson himself would soon publish them.
When this however became doubtful, I remember to have
formed the design of collecting as many as I could of his
originals, which at that time would not be a few: but
finding there was no encouragement to be expected for such
a work, and that those which I had already collected
would not defray their own expence, nor have been ever
published had it not been for the liberal support and pa·-
tronage of the Highland Society of London, I gave up the
pursuit of Gaelic poetry; about which I became so care-¹
less, that I never took the trouble of transcribing or pre-2,

serving several pieces that had fallen into my possession. . .

Some I lost, some I gave away, and some still meet me in
the bose-m of this οι· the other book. Had Ι had the second
,eight to foresee that such things would one day be in re-
quest, I might have now had many. In the original
poems and translations which 1 had published, I had occa-
sion to introduce several passages of Mr Maepherson’s ori-
ginals into the notes; for, without searching for them, Ῑ ⁷
had got considerable portions of several οἱ those poema ⁴
