‚4‘ earth, though perhaps not ever strictly men, nor yet con-2
“ stantly regarded as giants. Such are Odin, Thor‚ and the
‘⁶ other Teutonic gods: such are F ingal, Oscar, and the
.“ rest of the Fingalians among the ancient Scots: ,such also
‚⁶⁶ are Hercules, Bacchus, and even Jupiter himself, with ali
“ his ‚sons and daughters, among the ⁸original Greeks; a

‘⁶ people who agreed in many particulars, with our own e

“ ancestorc in northern Europess. ’'

Mr. Hill, in his 4‘ assumed character of a profest author‚”
made a discovery which had- escaped the notice of all other
authors : For he found that Ossian’s heroes bore a striking
resemblance to the followers of Mahomet in the monopo-
lizing of wives, and shutting them up in a kind of Haram

¹which they called a Castle. “ This eastlerstood in the isle η’

“ of Skye, and their women were confined rin it; ⁴ For,
“ (said Mac Nab), they kept many women like the,-
¹·‘ Turks †.'‘

Never was ingenuity practised more successfully than it

was ‘by Mr. Mac Nab. For what he told in pleasantry,¹

and in opposition to the current belief of his country, was
mld with 30 serious an air, that Mr. Hill believed it impli-
citljm and yet expressed a doubt of what he wrote him ia
good earnem, as follows:

‘³‘ Sm,
“ Ι send you this copy of Ossian’s Prayers. Ι
‘⁶ could give you more now, if I had time to copy them:

‘⁶ tnem I gaz e you was partly composcd, when they went Ἰ

“ si om their residence (in Cromgleann nan cloch) that is
‘⁶ Glenly on Perffishire, to hunt ro Ireland.

ALnx. M‘NAB.
