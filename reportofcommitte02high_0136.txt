120 REPORT oN TH'E

The heroes gave a hundred turns of strength,
By the border of the sea, on the smooth white beach÷
The blast of their nostrils was heard across' the hillocks‚·
And the noise of their feet in the struggle.
Conal was thrown down by the mighty‚
who bound him, without a wound like the rest.
Arduous was the deed he atchieved
On the shore of the dark-coloured ocean?

Conal sends for Cuchullin to oppose the vi&orious
stranger, whose progress to the combat is described
with the same sublime and terrible imagery which
is given in Maepherson's transsation of the Death of
Cuchullin. ²⁸

²³* The same passage is found almost verbatim in Smith’s Ma·
παν. ⁴ This paffage,' says Dr Smsth, in a note on that poem,
(Scan Dana, p. 262.) ‘is much admired in the original, and is
therefore inserted for the sake of such as may understand it.’-
Such striking passages, which, from the impreffion they makes
are in the mouth of every reciter, are often thus transferred from
one poem to another, when they are applicable to the story or
fituation. The fituation of Fingal in the poem of Manos is cer«
tainly better suited to this poetical description of the terrers of
his march, than that of Cuchullin in this poem of Conloch.
The subje& of this paffage is remarkable, as the Spirit of Lo* ·
has been a cause of dispute among the inquirere into the authen·
tit-{ty of the poems of Offian0 ⁶
