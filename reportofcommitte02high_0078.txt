62 REPORT oN THE

die. His wife Eub-choma, anxious for his fate, em-
barked in a ffiiff, with her infant son Ogall at her
breast‚ in quest of her lord, whom she found in the
pitiable situation we have described, and was able to
carry to her boat, where they were discovered next
morning by Offian‚ who had sailed in quest of them,
speechless and dying. He was only able to save the

child. .

The opening of the poem is in that spirit of me-
lancholy which Offian indulges, when he recals the
deeds of the heroes of his race.

‘ Is not this filence of night mournful,
While she spreads her dark clouds over the vales ἓ
Sleep has descended on the youth of the chace
Upon the heath, his dog resting against his knee.
The children of the mountains he pursues
In his dream, while his sseep is forsaking him-
Sleep‚ ye children of fafigue,
While each star but ascends the height.
Sleep, swift dog of the course,
Offian will not interrupt your ssumbers.
Ῑ am watching alone ι
Soothing to me is the gloom of night,
While I travel from dell to dell,
Without hope of morning or dawn.--
Spare thy light, O sun Ξ
And do not consume so fast thy torches ι
Like the king of the Fingalians‚ generous is thy foul,
But thy liberality will hereafter fail.
Spare the torches of thousand flames
In thy blue hall, when thou goest
Under the dulky gates to sseep‚
Beneath the darken'd skirt of the western sky.
Spare them, before they leave thee alone,

Asr
