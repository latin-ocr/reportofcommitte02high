they are of that kind that Mr Maepherson, Ι think judicis Γ
ι01151)1 rejects, 35 Irish imitations of the works of Ossiam *
‚One Angus Fletcher, a 511611111“-0111661·, was here about two 1
days ago at my desire, he can repeat many of these poems,
but none of those Mr Maepherson has translated, except a
part of the poem entitled, the Battle of Lora, and that ''
very much corrupted. But from my own memory, I can x
assure you, that Morla’s proposal to Cuchullin, Fingal,
b. ii. p. 26, with Cuchull'ln's answer‚ and Morla' s reply3
-is a just translation. So is the whole episode of Borbar
and Faineasolis, Fingal, b. 111. p. 45 and 46, and Fi.nga1,‘
b. iv. p. 57 and 58, from ,“ we reared the sun beams,'³
&c. to ,“ now like a hundred different winds.” 1 can
still repeat some of these in the original. The whole j
poem of Dar· thula I have frequently hemd, but Ι 161116111-
ber no part of it. All these, and many more, I heard in ¹
the Island of Sky‚ xvh'en Iwas a little boy, from an old'
man who nsed to repeat them to me for some tobacoe, which
I procured him as often as I wanted to hear 1116111. This
man died when I was bnt very young, and Ι could never
since meet with any person that could repeat so many of
,the poems of Ossian, or so perfectly. Ι am sorry I cannot
give you or the public any more satisfaction on 11115 point.
Had such an enquiry been made fifty years sooner, I 3111
persuaded hundreds could attest that Mr Maepherson’s
translations are really what they pretend to be. With
sincere esteem, I arn ᾖ
Your affectionate brother, and
most humble servant,
