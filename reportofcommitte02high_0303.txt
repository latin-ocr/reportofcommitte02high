. There is no word in the Gaelic lang-uage that bears the·
, most distant likeness to ’Noavil‚ which begins this quota-
'⁴ tion. It is to be presurned from the English that is given
ferit, Dost thou imagine, that the translator read, or took Ξῖ,

'v for An Saoil. And if we read it so, the literal translation

ι of the passage is as follows-—
’ Dost thou imagine that he was equal to the son of
Comhalv?

That king who ‘was over the heroes of Fingal.

All the men of the world might enter

Into his hall unbidden.

Ἴ “ kingdoms unsent for.''

. There seems but one way of accounting for so singular a
