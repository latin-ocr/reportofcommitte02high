'ly introduced into some poems and tales, in which it ought
to have no place. 1 remember, for instance, to have
<heard 30 years ago, a long tale (recited by one M‘Phailj
a taylor in Lorn), of which the hero was Conal Gulbann
, mac righ Lochlann, and if Ι had then translated it, Ι would
μ have called him, as Ι heard him called, son of the king of
Lochlin. But this Conal Gulbann appears from lrish his-
tory to have belonged not to scandinavia, but to Loigh-
eann (Lagenz'a) in Ireland. Thus, some of Mr M.'s ixi-1
advertencies, in which he plainly appears to have followed
the oral recitation, without a due investigation into history, ‚
may tend to illustrate the authencity of his poems. So
’ may also the description of some scenes, and names of
places, of the existence of which he had no opportunity
of having any knowledge3- as I had formerly occasion to
show in one or two instances. Proverbial expressions,
names of places, called time out of mind after some of Os*
sian’s heroes, allusions to their customs and manners, with
the remains of these poems being still found in· Ireland (as
wellas in the Highlands of Scotland,- as testified by Mr
Walker in his History of the Irish bards), and the notices
occasionally to be met with in old Scottish and Irish wri-
ters on this subject, would also tend to throw much light
upon your enquiry. The institution of bards, retained in
the families of several chieftains till the present century,
'will account for the preservation of these poems by ora}
, tradition; as will also the manners of the people‚ whose
winter-evening entertainment was, till very lately, the re-
petition of po‘ems, tales, and songs. The language of
these poems being still intellig-itale, exceptIng some words,
may be accounted for, from having been constantly repeat-
ed and made familiar, and from the* Highlanders having
always remained a separate people, secluded from the rest
of the world by their peculiar language, customs, and
manners. So the wild Arabs retain, I believe, to this day„
