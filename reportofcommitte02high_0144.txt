colleffions, and the circumstance of parallel passages
sometimes occurring in poems bearing a different
title in Smith's to thataffigned them by Kennedy‚
seem to the Committee to afford an argument rather
for than against their authenticity‚ especially when
the manner of obtaining those poemS‚ from the· re-

One of the poems colle&ed by Kennedy, entitled
Cart-il, the Committee has never seen any where else.
Though with a fimplicity bordering on rudeness, it
is extremely striking in the Gaelic, but very difficult
to be transsated. It is given entire in the Appendix,
ΝΟ. 22. in Kennedy's own orthography‚ and with
it the preamble or argument with which he accom-
