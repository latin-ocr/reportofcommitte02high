LETTERS To DR. BLAIR. 33

Lucan. Covinns‚ or Covinarius, seems to have been de-
rived from the word Coffin, in the Teutonic language,
which was a branch of the old Celtic3 and though it was
imported to England very probably by the Saxons, itis
lost in the Gaelic. Our fathers, who were in use to carry

I have just now before me a poeticaI relation, by Ossian,

'im Caesar’s time, few or no experienced manufacturers had
found their way to our country3 yet, in a poem of Os-
siarm, whose scene lies in Ireland, (it is no other than his
