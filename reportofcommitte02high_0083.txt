POEMS oF ossxAN. 67

Feeble was her voice, and few her words 3
I raised her up with my hand,
But she laid my palm on the head ofher son,
While her figh rose frequent.—
Dear child, vain is thy fondling,
Thy mother no more {hall arise.
I shall myself be a father to thee,

But Evz'rallin *³ is no more l’

The conclufion of the poem is in that dignified
stile of sorrow and of praise, which Fingal, whose
kamentation over Gaul it contains, is always repre-

sented, i1i the ancient poenis, as uttering on the lc}

‘ What is the strength of the warrior,
Though he scatter, as wither'd leaves, the battle?
To-day though he be valiant in the field,
To-morrow the beetle will prevail over him !'

‘ Prepare, ye children of mufical strings,
The bed of Gaul, and his sun-bearn † by him,
VVhere may be seen his resting-place from afar,
Which branches high owrlhadow,
Under the wing of the oak of greenest {lom-ish,
Of quickest growffi, and most durable form,
Which will {hoot forth its leaves to the breeze of the shower,
While the heath around is still wither'd.
Its leaves, from the eittremity of the land,
Shall be seen by the birds of summer,
