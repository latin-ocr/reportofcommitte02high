or PASSAGES. 193

‘⁸ Vain [I said] is thy expectation‚ mighty as thou art,
That the strength of thy hands of war, or thy pYowess,
Can ever accomplish our destruction.

Many a hero will be found, of our race,
Whom thy battle shall never be1.d.’'
y He spoke with the force of a breaking wave„
‘⁶ Where shall one hero of those be found?
I prevail over the mighty;
Their battle yields in my presence,
As the decayed grove of the mountain
Before the rapid sweep of the whirlwinda
If Ι do not receive, with consent,
That submission which the dread of my furious strife re..
I shall possess myself of Erin for life [quires,
In defiance of Cormac and of Fingal.''

'When the two chiefs arose
. In the strength of their swords ancl their shidds,
The solid earth was removed by their heels
In the terror-raising contest. [leys
¹ As the sound of a wood which opposesthe wind of the val-
‘ Was the struggle of the champions‚ maintained in equal
By night, and by day, [poise.
They continued the varying struggle, and the doubtful ex-
ernon.

 

Once we wrestled on Malmor3 our heels overturned the
wood. Rocks fell from their place; rivulets changing
their course, fled murmuring from our side! Three days
we renewed the strife3 heroes stood at a distance and trem-
bled. On the fourth, Fingal says, that the King of the·
Ocean feu! but Swaran says, he stood.

Let dark Cuthullin yield to him that is strong as the.

storms of his land ! Ibid. p. 221.
