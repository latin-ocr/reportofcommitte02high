POEMS or ossum. :39

SIR, Kincardine‚ 4th March 1801.

As Ι have not seen Mr Laing’s history, I can
form no opinion as to the arguments wherewith he
has attempted to discredit Offian’s poems : the at-
tempt could not come more naturally than from
Orcadians*. Perhaps the severe ehecks given by the
ancient Caledonians to their predatory Scandinavian
predeeeffors raised prejudices not yet extinCt. I con-
ceive how an author can write under the influence
of prejudice, and not senfible of being acted upon
by it.

Ι stand persuaded, that Mr Laing’s arguments
cannot stagger my belief in the authenticity of Os-
fian’s poems. Before Mr Macpherson could know
his right hand from his left, I have heard fragments
of them repeated, and many of those fragments I
recognized in ΜΓ Macpherson's transsation.

Fingal's standard was my very early acquaintance:
θ Togair Deo Grein e re Crann, Brattach Fhinn ’ibu
mhor a meas! The concluding confli& betwixt Fin-
gal and the king of Lochlin engaged my young fan-
cy so much, that the following stanza is still remem-
bered by me.

⁴ Tilgidar dhubh 'n airm dhaithte,
Fiachadar spairn 'nda laoich.
Clachan agiis talamh troni

Do ghluaisd iad le bonn ’n cos)

³⁶ ΜΓ Laing is a native of Orkney.
