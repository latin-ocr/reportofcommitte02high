account of its inimitable beauty and harmonicus versifica- ’·

tion. The original of this piece suffered even in the hands
of Mr Pdacphersmn though he has shewn himself inferior
to no translator. The copy or⁴ edition which he had of
this poem is very different from mine3 I imagine it will,
in that respect, be agreeable to Mr Percy. The gentle-
man who gave it me, copied, iit from an old MS. which Mr
Blacpherson hal no access to peruse before his Fingal came
abroad.

Ullin's Ἤρη· Song will, I hope, give satisfaction‚ as it is
a singular species of poetry, and refers to a very ancient
custom. 'l'lze {senileman who gave me this valuable piece
of antiquit-v, tolcl me, that he had formerly given ΜΓ Mac-
pherson a copy of it at full length.

All that can be said of my translation of these pieces·

is, that it is extremely lireraL and that it was not attempted
to imitate the conciseness and strength of the original.

Ι can likewise assu-re you, upon my honour, that I never
received any of these originals from Mr Macpherson, nor
took the least asssisfance from his translation„ This was‘ so
fai· from being the case, that after ἶ had done my transla-
tion, and compared it with his, I was obliged to reject se-
veral proper phrases, only because he had used them.

if you forward these'specimens to Mt Percy, he cer-
tainly will make the requisite allowances for the difference
of copies. Others to whom he will perhaps shew them,¹

and who are less known to the manner in which our an· -’

cient poetry was preserved, shall not be equally candid.

But after yon have convinced men of the nicest taste in ’ἶ

Europe, it would be a mistake in any one to endeavour to
, convince those who have not —the power of believing, οι·
