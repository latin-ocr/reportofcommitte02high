THE BED O‘F GAUL.

‘ Ο spread the bed of Gaul, ye sons of the strings‚
and his sun-beam close by him, where his bed may
be marked from afar, though overffiadowed with
lofty boughs; under the oak of the greenest blow,
that quickest grows, and of the most lasting hue,
that pours out her leaves on the breath of the
ffiower, though the field all around be withered.
Her leaves, from the utmost bounds, {hall be seen
by the birds of summer, and every bird, as he
comes, alights on the top of the bough of strumen.
Gaul shall heartheir chaunting in his mist, and vir-
gins finging of Evirchoma. Till the succeeding
changes take place, the memory of you shall not be
torn asunder. Till the stone moulder into (11111,-
till with age this branch {hall wither‚--till the brooks
cease to rum—till the source of the mountain stream
run dry‚—till in the flood of time'be lost the age of
every hard, song, and subje& of every tale 3-—the
stranger {hall not ask, ‘ Who is the son of Mami?
or, ‘ Where dwells the king of Strumon ,θ’
