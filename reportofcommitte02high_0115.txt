POEMS OF OSSI'ANa

Engliffi Transsation.

The Author of this is Ossian.

f Know ye a short tale of Fingal !
A tale that claims your attention.
It concerns the son of Comhal of powefful sway 3
WVhom‚ while I live, I {hall in woe remember.
We were few in his train,
By the fall of Roya‚ that softly murmur-3,
When we saw a large sailed boat afar,
Which conveyed a fair over ocean.
Fifty alert heroes sat around the king ;
Trusty were their deeds in support of right.

How unlike, alas ! are they whom Ι behold in γονὴν fleam,

O ye, whose strength could controul each land t
”We all stood up in haste,

Except Fingal himself, and Gaul,

To wait on the high bounding boat,

Whose course was parting the wax-es.

It neither ssackened nor rested,

T ill it entered our wonted haven-

Ξῖ croffed the pool below the fall,

WVhen out of it rose a daughter of youth.
Brighter she ihone than a beam of the sun ᾗ
Her air and manner exceeded her form.

In presence of the fair, who came from afar,
We all respe&ful stood.

She proceeds to the tent of Fingal,

¹And greets him in mufical aecent.
The son of Comhal made suitable reply3,
