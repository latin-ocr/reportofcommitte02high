The Committee sets down these lines, forgetting,
in the feeling produced in itself, to how few, how
very few, of the readers of this Report‚ they can
give any idea. But it is tempted to quote them,
with the purpose of calling forth the testimony of
those few by whom they will be understood, that
the Committee‚ in its account of the original of this
poem, doe-s not deceive, or at least has no intention J
to deceive, the Society or the public.

ln Kennedy’s collection, as well as in those fur-
nished the Committee by others, are several paffages
nearly, and sometimes altogether the same, with
,Maepherson’s transsation5 but neither in Kennedy⁵s e
collection, nor in those of the others, does the poem ᾗ
in which they occur always correspond in its title‚J}
story, or general tenor, with that in which the re<
sembling paffages are given by Macpherson. Of'.
these, as far as they are found in the poem of Pin„
gal, Dr D. Smith has, at the desire of the Society,{¹
formed a seleffion, which will be found in the Ap-'s-
pendix, ΝΟ. 15. To this paper the Committee re-fa
