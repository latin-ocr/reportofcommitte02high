PoEMs oF ossum. 125

They proceeded to fight with the guaiae* dart,
With unabated eagerness and hardihood,
Till the graceful youth received a wound
From the nurseling of hard fought battles.
He fell, like a tree 'of flourishing growth,
In the wilderness of pines, unexpe8oedly.

The roek from which it sprung resounds to its fall t
Its bank of earth shakes, and bursts asunder.

“ O son of youth, who hast come from a foreign land 3

By me has thy wound been given.
, Soon shall thy stone be exalted.

’ Do not conceal from us for ever who thou ai't.

, Tell me now, without reserve,

= Since fate has met thee in my field of battle,
Who thou art, and what thy name,
'And from what quarter thou hast come.'‘

“ Alas! that thou didst fail to know 1116,

,My noble, high-minded, beloved father!
‘XVhen my dart, with sideway aim and fccble cast,
Sought thee with averted barb.’'
