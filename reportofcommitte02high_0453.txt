ψ pile largest and most valuable collection of Gaelic mami-
ζ ²scripts now remaining in the ¹Highlands of Sco-fland.

The public are no strangers tossthe desire with which the
late Lord Hailes was always actuated for informing himself
'of whatever respected the history and antiquities of this
country. The course of my duty, while I was Sheriff of
Bate, frequently led me to meet with his Lordship when
holding the Circuit Court at Inveraray. On one of these
occasions, our conversation turning on the different opinions

,entertained as to the authenticity of the Poems published

by Mr. M‘Pherson, his Lordship expressed a particular de-
‘sire toknow how far any Gaelic manuscripts of tolerable
antiquity were preserved in the Highlands of Scodand, and
particularly, whether any of them contained remains of an-
cient poetry connected with 01· similar to those which Mr-
Mf‘Pherson had publis'ned.

' Ι told his Lordship‚ that though the gentlemen from
the remotes parts of the Highlands of whom I had made
such inquiries, talked generally of the existence of manu-
scripts, and of their belief that some of them, and par-
ticularly one or two belonging to the family of Clamanald
or the descendants of their bard, had got into the hands of
Mr. M‘Pherson , yet that I had not been fortunate enough
to meet with any persons who had themselves seen or ex-
amined such manuscripts, or were able to give me an ac-
count of their nature, their supposed¹ antiquity‚ or contents,
excepting Dr. Hugh M‘Leod, professor of church history
at Glasgow, who had assured me he had seen and examin-
ed several Gaelic manuscripts, partly written upon vellum,

ss, ,and apparently of great antiquity‚ in the possession of Mr.
M‘Pherson, containing portions of poetry mixed with other
compositions. At the same time I informed his Lordship, that
I had met with many persons, and some particularly among
the clergy, whose taste and judgment I could rely upon,
