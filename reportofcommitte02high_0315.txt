‘7³24‘the first b'ook *of Maepherson's Temora. lt opens?
*⁴⁴⁶* with a lamentation for the death of Chaoilte‚ which is
{⁸4⁴ foreign to the rest of the son g3 a practice not uncommon
Μ, among the poems attributed to Ossian‚ and similar to
1 4⁶ that of Pindar‡,”

Now, in this poem we observe the following passages—⁴
V. 3. “ Did you hear of Fingal’s journeys on every forest
‘⁶ in Erinj? Great Cairbar with his armour sent for us to
, ⁴⁶ destroy us.” Be it remarked that forest, in the English

Δ of scotland, does not mean an extensive wood5 but a monna

ῃ tainous tract which is stocked‚ or abounds, with decr and
:¹²¹ other game. ,

ff V. 6,-12, “ The last (lay of our drinking match,

’- ⁸⁴ Cairbar spoke with his tremcndous voice. ⁶ I want we
ἓ* should exchange arms, brown Oscar, that comer—,t from

⁴3⁸⁶ Albion.’ Oscar. ⁶ What exchange do you want to

(ί make, great Cairbar‚ who even preqs the ships into your
Π “ service3 and to whom I and all my host belong, in time
· ‘⁶ of war and battle. Surely it is oppression to demand
Δ ⁴⁶ our heads when we have not arms to defend ourselves.
[κ The reason of your doing so is our being deprived of
*⁴⁶ Fingal and his Son. Were Fingal and my father with
‘⁶ us as they used to be, you would not during your whole¹
*⁴ θ’* life obtain the breadth of your feet in Erin.

Ἰ '- ⁸‘ The great hero (Cairbar) was filled with rage at the
ἢ *a‘* dispute which arose between them. There were ex-
. ‘⁶ ceeding horrible words between Cairbar and Oscar„
if ‘⁴‘ That night the women had a warm dispute about the
ζ’ ‘³ heroes, and even Cairbar and Oscar themselves were

“ half and half angry.

  

‘⁶ Nine score men armed with bows and arrows⁷ that
J ‘i‘ came to destroyus3 all these fell by the hand cf Oscar
, ⁸⁶ enraged at the sons of Ireland †.''
