ἔ( could not talk English, I was obliged to supply myself
’ “ with another cottager‚ to translate whilst he sung. The
“- following poem I wrote down from the mouth of our in-

Nor could a man of this description fail to consider honest?
as the hec? policy of a stranger who §ought for information.
But an attempt at deception, which was as: harmless as ic
was artles33, would seem to him a litter subject fm· pleasant-

of humour. Hence we can account for some rare pit-ces οἱ
