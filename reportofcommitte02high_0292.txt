† I eopied at Mac-Nab’s‚ out of one of his MSS. the following lines, rela-
tive to Gaul abovementioned; which relate an incident remarkably similar to
lhe stories told of Achilles, Hercules, the lewish Samson, and the Teutonic
giam Thor, &c. Gaul is generally esteemed one of the greatest of the gie-ms:
this extract describes one still mightier than he.

Cho (lrugain mo sgian do riogh na do Fhlath

No do dhuin air bith gun amhith no mhath

Naoid guinuiran do sgun achuire anamsa Goull

’Scho na fhuigin a thri annun biodh mo sgian nam dhonr

Ach dom gan tug luthadh lamb-ada anancezm ‘Ghuill 'anathadh
Gheig’ e rann bhris e enai geal anceaumhum hom a mhi lean :a
Chuir cmhala faraseal mhaoidh eain adheud rum h'or

Chuir e falam hors aghuiuidi agus enig me air na truighe
Sb’huin ads-ianm don tallamh ’sgula bhath belhidh ,fhaiil ’ann
Farnach deanadh andan ach ball gorm na glas

Se ruda dheanadh an sgian an riach sanrrachadh abhor.

'l'he sense of these lines, Mac-Nab gave me as follows: “ Gaul and Uvavat
‘· had a violent conflict: Gaul had a knise, Uvavat had none: Gaul stabbed
‘⁶ Uvuvat nine times with' his knife: Uvavat said, if he had had his knife, he
“ would not have suffered a third part so much 3 at last, lifting up his arm,
“ he struck Gaul on the skull, and fracturvd it 3] broke his bone ; removed hi·

“ brow; knockt out his teeth3 knoekt off his knee-pan, and his five toes; all ss ¹

‹‘ at one blow. The mark of the blow shall remain in the ground for ever-‘¹ ⁸
'Gaul‘s knife, mentioned here, seems to have been a kind of dirk ; whieh, like
phe dagger of HudibraS‚ served in these rude times, β
Either for fighting, or for drudging;
j And when’t had stabb’d‚ or broke a head3
It would serape trenchers, or chip bread.
