bul: the* cover of it has the following date in a modern
hand, though black letter. ‘¹‘ Gleann Masain an cuige la
deag do an . . . Mh : : t do bhlian ar tsaoirse Mile da chead,
trichid sa hocht.'’ That is, Glen Masan, the 15th day of

The date being so particolar, mnst be thought to have been
taken from the MS. itself when it was more entire than it
is now, for it is greatly mutilated. Glenmasan, where it was
written, is a valley in the district of Cowal, which, with
Glenurchay and Gleneiti, two other vales of Argyllshire.,
is celebrated in the passage to be presently quoted from it,
as the scene in which the sons of Usnoth followed the
chace.

It gappears from a note on the margin of its 15th leaf,
that it formerly belonged to the Rev. William Campbell‚
minister of Kilchrenan and Dalavich, who was a native of
Cowal, and to whom it may perhaps have descended from
his grand uncle ΜΓ. Robert Campbell in Cowal, an accom-
plished scholar and poet, who wrote the eighth address pre-
'fixed to the Archaeologia of Mr. Edward leyd.

It consists of some mutilated tales in prose, interspersed
with verse. One of them regards⁴ the tragical story of
Deardir, Dearduil‚ or Darffiula, and the three sons of
Usnoth‚ Naos, Ainle, and Arduu, from which the following
extract is made, and a sac simile exhibited in Plate III.
