POEMS οὲ ossum. 65

Ῠουης is the man-child on her bosom ;

Sweet is her hum in his ear ;

But a figh has wafted away the song,

On Gaul thy thoughts are fixed‚ Evirchoma l'

The break of tenderness in Gaul's recolleffion of
his wife and child, which croffes for a moment the
stern unyielding resolution not to turn his back on
his foes, which, with the superstition of those he-
roic times, he supposes would give anguilh and shame
to his brave father's spirit, is one of those happy
strokes which mark the true feeling and spirit of
a poet.

⁶ Mornz'! behold me from the mountain.
Thy own sou] was as an impetuous current
Foaming white within a rocky strait :
Such is the foul of thy son.—
Evirchoma ! Ogall !—
But mild beams belong not to the storm ;
The foul of Gaul is ἐι] the roar of battle.’

The anxiety of the wife and mother is nobless
naturally expreffed in the following lines uttered by
Evirchoma.

‘ What has detained thee, my love!
Behiqrt'sthe rest in the Isse of Fre-ona,
While Ι bewail on the {helving rocks,
And echo answers to my speech ἒ
Might'st thou not have returned by this time,
Though mischance by sea had befallen thee,
Thy expetstation being towards the child of thy love,
Who pours with me the ear-nest figh ἒ

Woeful‚ that thou canst not hear, my love l T
Ε he ’
