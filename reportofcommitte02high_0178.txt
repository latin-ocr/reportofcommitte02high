Ι am not at 311 surp rised that, at 3 time when the spirit of J}

party, and natior al quarrek, 310 risen to such a height, the ι

as a great person who has patronized F ingal, must not only

be depressed, bur made 35 little 35 possible in every re«- ,-

sne-ct, Mr Maepherson must be involved in the same cruci ⁴
ersecution.

But to come directly to the questions you propose—-I ‹am
not able to say, with any degree of certainty, that I have
seen, but can affirm that 1 113νο not perused‚ any MSS.
containing either the whole, or a part, of the poems pub-
lished by our friend. I never made it my business to find
out, or examine, such paper33 and the Isle 111 which I
live at present 0311 hardly afford such curiosities. About
twenty years back, Ι was settled in a part of the country
where there was an ancient little family, the head of which
united the professione. of the bard, genealogist, and senna-
chy. The bard of that family whom Ihad occasion to ”
know, was a man of some letters, that is to say, he and ’
his ancestors, for many ages, had received their education s
111 111511 Colleges of poetry and history, and understood ¹
‚ the Latin tolerably well. The man who was of my ac-
quaintance, was thought an antiquary, in the Highland ν·
acceptation of the word, and had some MSS. in his posq 1

50551011. But he 15 dead long since, and his office abolish„

gentlemffiz may very probably have all the MSS. formerly ξ
belonging 10 these old laureata, if preserved, in his custody τ’

undertaken to write to Clanranald upon this subject, 1· have, =·ss
