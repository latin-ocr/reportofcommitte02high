Smith, late surgeon to the Breadalbane Fencibles,
one of the best Celtic schol'ars of the· present time,
the Committee would endeavour to express its obli-
gadon, were not its thanks rendered nnneceffary by
those of the Society itself‚ xioted to that gentleman,
in a manner most justly due to the ability and un-
wearied attention with which he has affisted the
Committee in the progress of this busmess3 an as-
fistance, without which, its Report could never
have been compleated.

The Comntittee‚ unwilling to. lengthen the Ap-
pendix to this Report⁹ which it fears will to most 0.f
its readers, ‘appear‘ already too long, has given only
speciniens or extra&s of such documents as it aps-
peared to the Committee might fairly be judged of
¹by such specimens or extra&s ; bnt the papers them·
‘selves are open to the inspeffion of any person wish-
ing io examine them more thoroughly‚ who will
vtake the trouble of applying to the Committee for

that purpose.
