POEMS OF OSSIAN. 101

A close helmet burnished round ehe head
Of the da'untless man of strength ς
Α black·ribbed {hield on his arm,
Whose field was marked with figured sports.
A huge and maffy sword
was fixed on the fide of the mighty‚
Over whose hilt he sportful exercised‚ ι
As he appr'oached our people.
Two javelins, winged with death,

. Stood in the hollow of his ssrield.
For strength, for prowess, and for might,
T'ne hero matchless seemed.
A noble air and king-like eye
Marked his manly face 3
Fresh was his bloom‚ and white his teeth,
As he rode the *founding surge in his speed.
To land he bounded in his course,
Nor did he regard the proffer of Fingal.
Our fifty heroes then present,

⁷ VVhose deaths were in his foul,
Dreaded the fate of the man so bold of deed,
Nor was there a hero of us untroubled in thought.
Off his wave as he came to land,
The far famed king did auk,
‘⁴ Do you know, O maid,
If that be the man you spoke ,⁸³²
“ I do know, son of Comhnss> 3 (ij ⁷¹·'2r‘s3sr !
Much hal-m, I sear, he will de ιζ’) ξηροὶ-,λη
He will attempt to bear me away,
Though great be thy might, generous Fingal.’‘
Oscar ⁷* and Gaul sterted from tls-eir place,
Heroes fierce and vi&0rious Ain conflffi,
