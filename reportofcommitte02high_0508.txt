13:30 COMPARIsoN‘

(O ad reverse ! O fatal hour
In mangled heaps to die Ε)
Too mighty Erin ! to thy power, ’ᾗ
Pale victims, here they lie.‘’ ”

Kennedy's edition of the poem goes on to relate, that
after the fleet of Lochlin proceeded to sea, the men, abash..
ed at the failure of their enterprize, prevailed upon Manos
to alter his course, and steer for the shore they had left, tq
renew the attack upon Fingal 3 which counsel proved
disastrous in the issue, Manes himself, and most of his¹
people, having fallen in the battle which followed their
second landing. This conclusion of the poem will best ape,
pear from the original.

’S e comhairle thug na sloigh

Ar Manos mor na long {zigh
Tighin chuig' ar an ais o’n chuan
Go maithibh sluagh Innsefssil.
Thin na laoich nan caogadaibh borb,
Bu mhor an toirm ar an trizigh.
Mar fhuaim tuinne bha gach treud‚
Is faram nan ceud ann ar dail.
Chuir Fionn teachdaire gu luath
Go Manos nan ruag is nan gniomh.
‘⁶ Cfflite bheil do mhionna mora
Fhir nach cum a choir ach cli.”

F hreagair an Triath gu fiata borb‚
Ar am biodh colg anns gach greis, ¹
“ Fhixgas iad in deallt an fheoir
Ar an lon ud siar ma dheas.'’

Thug sinn an sin deannal cruaidh
Mar nach fac ’s nach cuala mi.
Mar theirbeitt teine na nial
Bha gach triath ἐι sgatha sios⁴
