the skill and dexterity of his men in working them, and
their intrepidity in the greatest storms—of which he gives
the most striking description. I can account for it no other
way than his having been born in Badenoch, one of the
most inland parts of this kingdom, where not having ac-
cess to be acquainted with that kind of imagery, he did not
'therefore perhaps understand the original poems.

With regard to the authenticity of the poems, they were,
by the traditions of our forefathers, as far back as we can
trace them, ascribed to Ossian, and to the most remote pe·-
riod of time, of which we have any account. It is a word
commonly used in the Highlands to this day, when they
express a thing belonging to the most remote anfiqusty, to
call it, fiountachk‚ i. e. belonging to the time of Fingal.
I know not a country in the Highlands, which has not
places that are famous for being the scenes of feats of arms,
strength, or agility, of some of the heroes of the race of
F ing-al. However much the several clans differ in the tra-
ditionary history of their respective families, they are
all agreed, as far as ever I could leam, with respect to the
genuineness and authenticity of Ossian's poems.

But the most effectual method, I presume, of satisfying
the doubts of the gentlemen who deny Highlanders the ho-
'nour of these monuments of the genius and prowess of·
their ancestors, is to invite them to the Highlands, and to
⁸bring interpreters along with them, that they may exa-e
mine the matter themselves. You may assure them of a
hospitable reception3 and wherever they go to, the gentle-
‘men and clergy will find out to them the old men who still
have in memor-y most of the works of Ossian, and the
traditionary 'history of the Fingalians. I would engage

that they should return home sufficiently satisfied that these
‚poems belong to the time and country ‘to which they are
‚ascribed If any other material question occurs to you
