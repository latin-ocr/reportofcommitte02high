’⁸ Two several readings norw occur for ten lines of the MS. which, as
they are inconfistent with one another, so are they also with the tenor of
the poem. For whereas fifty were repeatedly stated to be the exa& num-
ber of warriors who accompanied Fingal on this occafion, yet in the first
of these readings, twenty-seven only are said to have engaged Daym, who
bound them3 though it is added immediately after, that au the warriors then
present were wounded, and Flan son of Morni ssain by him. And in the
second of the readings, fifty warriors are represented as saving their com-
panions from the sword of Daym, by a seasonable exertion of valour.
