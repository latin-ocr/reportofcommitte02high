That is-The four things which are requisite to be
'known in every regular composition are to be noticed in this
work of the Tain. The PLACE of its origin is the stone of
Fergus son of Roich‚ where he was buried on the plain of
Nai. The TIME sof it, besides, is that in which Diarmad
son of Cervail‚ reigned over Ireland. The AUTHOR, too, is
Fergus son of Roich ς for he it was that prompted it forth-

which Shenachan Torbda with three chief bards made to
'Guaire King of Connacht.

The subject and character of this TAIN bho Cuailgne is
concisely and justly expressed by Roderic O Flaherty.
