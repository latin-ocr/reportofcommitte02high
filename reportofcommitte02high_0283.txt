” But when in battle with our foes he join’d,

And sought the hottest dangers of the fight,
'The stoutest chiefs stood wond'ring far behind,
And none durst try to rival him in might· l

His ample shield then seem’d a gate of brass,
His awful sword did like the lightning shine ἶ
No‘force of steel could through his armour 1:255,
His spear was like a mast, or mountain-pine ἒ
Ev’n kings and heroes trembled at his name,
And conquest smil’d where’er the warrior came Σ

Great was the strength of his unconquer'd hand,

Great was his swiftness in the rapid racc ;
None could the valo-ar of his arm withstand‚

None could outstrip him in the days of chace.
Yet he was tendcr‘, merciful, and kind3

His vanquish’d foes his clemency confest;
No cruel purpose l'abour'd in his mind,

No ’thought of envy harbour’d in his brem,
He was all ζ(ζΐειςὶοῃε, bountcous, and benign,
And in his sou] superior to a king l

But now he's gone ἔ and nought remains but woe
For wretched me; with him my joys are ssed,
Around his tomb my tcars shall ever ssow,
The rock my dwelfing, and the clay my bed f
Ye metitis, and matrons, from your hills descend,
To join my moan, and answer tear for team
With me the hero to his grave attend,
And sing the songs of mourning round his bier,
Through his own grove his praise we -will proclttim,

J And bid the place for ever bear his name.
