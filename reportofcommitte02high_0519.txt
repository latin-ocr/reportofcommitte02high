Carril, the mild, strong, and elegant,
Fen breathless under the prees of valour ;
Relentless5 fieree, and minous was the stroke
Which laid the champion low in the hard fought con«
test !
‘⁶ My darling, my child, my love,
Sad is the wound thy death inflicts on thy father !'’
Said Fingal with spirit heavier drooping
Than the sun overeast by the sudden cloud of thunden
“ O Carril ! thou son of my love!
closed are thine eyes, locked thy teeth of whiteness,
Thy strength is swept away as by a mast,
Thy beauty is changed as the blossorn of branches.
“ No more shalt thou be seen
To tread the path to conflict‚
No more shall be heard the sound of thy shield,
Thou pride of battles ! coming to my aid.
‘⁶ Would that the overbearing strength of strangers
Or the king of the world had laid thee low ἔ
Then‚ O Carril! should I avenge thy death
Upon the Britons of victorious arms Ξ
‘⁴ Blest be thou, O graceful Carti] Ξ
Who defeated hundreds in battle.
Thou travelledst far, but fai-ther still did reach thy
fame
To every land where thy name was known.
‘⁴ ChearFuL sprightly and enlivening,
In the hall of Temom, among hundreds,
O hero! bloody in the chace !—
Sad to-day is the tale os thy death.
‘⁶ Would 'that thou hadst fallen in the battle of war-
riors,
Fair and gentle hero of the auburn ringlets Ξ
Then would the tace of Comhal revenge the injury,
