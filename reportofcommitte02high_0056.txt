Macpherson detailed of the exploits of Fingal3 my
memory has failed me even in the very line in which
it is most exercised. Had its decline kept off, I
could give your honourable Society more specimenS,
with which I had the honour of being early ac-
quainted. Here I cannot get my memory refreshed.
The pride of ancestry, the fortia fac‘Ja patrum, are
‹›bsolete themes: the preffure of the times, the
change of system, have brought forward other feel-
ings and speculations. Little else is left us of the
ancient Caledoniam than the refuse of their remains:
occupants hold their poffeffions, who are more able
to advancc the interest of lanfflords, and who are
more attached to Plutus than to Mars, to Tellus
than to the Muses. ’
’ What Sir John Dalrymple predicled concerning·
the Highlanders, at the close of the battle of Killi7
cranky‚ seems to be coming forward with hasty
strides. Let ΜΓ Laing read their character as drawn
by that masterly pen, and it will not seem to him
incredible‚ that a former age should, among the
Caledoniam, furnish such a hero as Fingal³ or such
a, bard as Offian.
