wondering at his* absurdity, who has it in his power at once ’ἶζ
to put the matter beyond a question, I doubt much whether

any other man can do it. All the manuscripts of conse-
quence are in his hands5 and he alone knows from what
parts of the Highlands, and from what personS, he col-
lected them. By obtaining these from him, and procuring

certificates from the persons in whose possession they have -

formerly been, and comparing them with the translation,
something might be done : but I have little hopes that any
manuscripts will be found in the Highlands, which have

not already fallen into his hands. These Islands never were q

possessed of any curious manuscripts, as far as Ι can learn,
except a few which Clanranald had, and which are all i'n
hlacpherson's possession. The few bards that are left
among us, repeat only detaChcd pieccs of these poems. I
have often heard, and understood thern ; particularly from

one man called John Mac Codrum, who lives upon my ι

estate of North Uist. I have heard him repeat, for hours

together, pocms which seemed to me to be the same with =

lxlacpherson's translati0n3 but as I had it not along with
mc, and could not remember it with sufficient exacmess, I
cannot positively affirm that what I have heard is precisely
the same with the translation. As Ι made no doubt of its

being the samo, Imight also, on that account, give less Ι

attention to discover any small differences. Theman ·

whom you mention, by the name of John Ossian, lives in

Hams. Ι hare heard nothing of him since Ι came last to

this country3 but was told, when I was here before, that s

mentioned to you, examined in the way you propose, in ⁸

he could repeat more of these poems than any man in these ἱ
