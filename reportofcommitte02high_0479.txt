ἐροῐιᾱε almost exactly with Sliabh nam beannfionn in Ken-
nedy’s collection, p. 29. The number of verses is the
same in both, and even the order of them, with two excep-
tions which do not alter the sense. Some variation occurs
in the reading at the zoth, 36th‚ 44th‚ and 4Sth verses. It
is observable‚ that the argument or preface of this pieee, as

account of it.

A less perfect edition of this beautiful poem is also
found under the title of La mor Seilg na Fez’nne, in the oral

written from memory by Archibald M‘Callum‚ and com-
municated through Mr. Malcolm M‘Donald.

the field of Gavra, corresponds very much with an edition
of Kennedy's (p. 148), and another of Mr. Malcolm Mac
Donald’s; neither of which is inferior to the Dean’s. The
, two last lines of the following stanza are even more happi-
ly expressed in Kennedy's edition than in his. ’

Chunnaic e righ Eirean
