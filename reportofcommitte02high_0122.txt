106 'REPoRT oN THE

He struck Art the son of Cairbar
With the second stroke.

So fell that hero,

Graced with his royal crown.

I am Fergus the bard,

Who have traversed many lands t
Aias ἔ that Ι survive the heroes,
To relate the tale of woe !’

The Socie'ty will observe, that the second of those
poems is the same story with that called by ΜΥ
Maepherson‚ in his transsation, the Maid of Graea,
and the third is on the subje& of the battle of Ga-
vra, where Oscar fell, an account of which makes
”the opening of Temora in Macpherson. The tone of
the first is sad and solemn, and perfeffly agrees with
the traditionary belief as to the fituation of Offian,
when he'survi'ved all the heroes of his race. It is
scarcely necessary for the Committee to repeat, that
these, and all the other transsations given in this
Report‚ are striffly literal‚ and must therefore be
expe&ed to convey to the mere English reader a
very imperfe& transcript only, either in point of
force or tenderness, of the original.
