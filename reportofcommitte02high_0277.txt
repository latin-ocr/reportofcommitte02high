Air a chluain thugte an t aium,
Loch meidhe faite ris an Loch,
Am biodh a Bheist anns gach uair,
Is a Craos a suas ris an Dos.

———-

WVHENCE come these dismal sounds that fill our ears !
Why do the groves such lamentations send !

Why sit the virgins on the hill of team,
While heavy sighs their tender bosoms rend ἔ

They weep for Albin with the flowing hair,
Who perish’d by the cruelty of Mey3

A blameless hero, blooming, young, and fair3
Because he scorn'd her passions to obey.

See on yon western hill the heap of stones,

Which mourning friends have raised o’er his bones 2

O woman l bloody, bloody was thy deed;
The blaekness of thy crime exceeds belief 3
