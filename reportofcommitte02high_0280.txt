Then pulls the fruit, and comes in safety back3

While his fierce teeth his tendes body gnaws.
He groans through anguish of the grievous wound,
And eries for help3 but, ah 3 no help was found!

At length, the maid, now wond’ring at his stay,
And rack'd with dread of some impending ill¹

She saw her lover struggling on the flood,

The dreadfill monster gnawing at his side;
She saw young Albin sainting‚ while his blood

With purple tincture dy’d the liquid tide ζ
