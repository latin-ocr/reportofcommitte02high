MR. M‘Pfflgnsoz—J’s POETRY. 16],

The broken skull and shiver’d helmet strow’d‚

The sandy plain that reeks with human blood;

He gasping falls, and shakes the thund’ring ground,
And dying, toss'd his quiv'ring limbs amand.—
Thus falls an oali, that long majestic stood

The tallest honours of the waving wood.
Deep-hack'd by the ship—wright’s unerring hand,
Groaus, slow-inclines‚ and falling, shakes the land..
