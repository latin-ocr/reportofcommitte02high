, And in the ancient MS. which formerly was the
, dean of Lismore'S, now in the poffeffion of the ΞΟΕ

Keigyt leich yownych mane reie⁰

Di yowmist er gi teir nert.'

There was a shorter and more rapid measure for
the lyrical parts of the compofition3 such was gea
nerally used for the Prosnacha Cama, the song of
incitement to battle, which it was the office of the
bards to sing, to animate the heroes when about to
engage the enemy. Such is the measure of some of
the odes given by Miss Brooke‚ and of the war-
song to Gaul, which is in the poffeffion of the Soa
, ciety. The opening of this war-song, as in one of
the Kilbride MSS. is as follows : its measure is quick,
rapid‚ and spirit-stirring‚ each line generally cona
taining one or two daelyls.
