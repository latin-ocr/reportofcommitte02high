'lt is the moze fssxtraordinary it escaped him, that “the great
'Dr. Johnson himself,’' who ‘is' mentioned in the beginning “’
ὀἱ his paniphlet‚ had taken particular notice of it.

“ There still (says the Doctor) remains in the islands,
‘⁴ though it is passing fast away, the custom of fosterage.
‘⁶ A laird, a man of wealth and emineme, sends his child, .
’ὅ either male or female, to a tacksman, or tenant,·to be
‘⁶ fostered. lt is not always his own tenant, but some

“ good effects. When Maedonald raised his rents, Mac-
