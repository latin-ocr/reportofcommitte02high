ciation of ideas, to imagine more than he had seen or heard.
He conceived that “ the 301th relating to the l inre, and'
“ their chieflain, Fion-mac-C0u1‚orFion-na-Ga‘cl, whom
. “ we call· ln English Fingal3 are wholly confiued to Ar-
“, gyllshire, and the Western ffigfflands, where the scene
“ of their actions is supposed to have lain*.’'

Ι And he asserted that ‘⁴ the songs preserved in the High- r
“ lands relative to the Fingalians‚ are wholly confined to
, ,θ’ the western coast of the Highlands opposite Ireland3
‘5 that the very traditions of the country themselves ac-
“ knowledge the Fingalians to be originally Irish3 and
’ “ that the genealogy of Fingal was there given him as fol.
“ lows: Fion Mac C0u1‚Mac Trathal‚ Mac Arsht Riogh
,. “ Erin, or King of Ireland, ‘thus attributing the origin of
“ his race to the lrish†.’'

Nothing short of the irresistible power of associated ideas
could have induced Mr. Hill to inform 1113 readers, that the
songs in question ‘⁶ are wholly confined to the western coast
‘⁶ of the Highlands, where the scene of thc- actions’' to
which they refer “ is supposed to have lain‚'' after he had
told thern, but a few pages back, that “ Mr. Stuatt, mini-
ᾗ “ ster of Blair, whom he visited in company with Mr.
· ‘⁴ Stokes—favoured them with the story of a song, relating
⁸⁶ to Dermid one of the Feinne—of which he afterwards
“ obtained a copy in the original Erse :’' aud that, ‘⁶ from
‘⁶ one Mac Nab, a blacksmith at Dalmaly, he obtained
⁶‘ many songs, which are traditionally attributed to
“ Ossian1.'' Blair and Dalmaly are inland places, very
remote from any part of the westem coast of the Highlandr
that is opposite to Ireland ; and if Mr. Hm had visited the
shires of Inverness, Ross‚ Sutherland‚ and Caithness, ’116
would have found the poems, tales, traditions, and local
names, which regard the Fingalians, to be as common there
