fi& LETTERS TO MR. MACKENZIE. ¹.
l
They flung their weapons on the ground,
And in each other grasp' the two heroes.
When thus began the struggle of the chiefs, ag*-
It was to us a weariness to be at rest3 ἱ·
T he stones and the heavy earth
Awoke under the straining of their feet.
The victorious son of Cumhal lifted up
vThe king of Lochlin high on his breast,
And struck his back down to the ground,
In the midst of the ranks of Innistore.
Thus fell the king of Lochlin the brave,
In presence ‘of all on the heath‚
And on him, though no honour to a king,
was put the tie of the three smalls, (i. e. his neck,

hands, and feet were bound.)

ΜΓ M.'s translation of the edition which he had of this ⁸
passage, is as follows: Finga]‚ b. v. p. 62.

“ The heroes met in the midst of their falling ‚speople-
There was the clang of arms ἔ there every blow, like the ’
hundred hammers of the furnace! Terrible is the battle
of the kings, and liorrid the look of their eyes, Their ,Ι
dark-brown shiclds are cleft in twain3 and their steel flies‚ ff
broken, from their helmets. They fling their weapons 'fi
down. Each rushes to his hero's grasp. Their sinewy 4'

  
  

arms hind round each other: they turn from side to sidejffs-
and strain and stretch their large spreading limbs beIOW. fg]
But when the pride of their stiength arose, they shook the.¹ ..
hills with their heels 3 rocks tumble fiom their places on f-
hi „3h3 the green-headed bushes are overturned. At length, y ¹
the s tzretgth of Swaran fell3 and the king of· groves 1552·¹
bound. ’⁹ “

From the above specimens‚ taken from a very incorrectis!
and single edition of this poem, you may, I think, form}

a pretty favourable idea of the faithfulness of Mt 2.. ’xi ᾖ
