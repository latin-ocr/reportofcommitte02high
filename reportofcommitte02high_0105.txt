ance with Mr Maepherson. Ι have the honour to
be, Sir, with very fincere esteem‚ your faithful and
most obedient servant,
’ J. ANDERSON?
Henry Mackenzie, Esq.

The MS. which accompanied Mr Anderson’s let-
ter was stitched in the form of a very small memo-
randum book, and confisted of two poems 3 one on
Deam, and another, a sort of heroic poem, in seve-
ral cantos, written, as appeared from some memo-
randums on one of its leaves, by Mr Maepherson,
¹when he taught a school in Badenoch. It contained
no evidence of the forgery of Osfian, which Μι-
Laing suspested, nor indeed any other evidence con-
ne&ed with this subjeci, except in so far as it shewed
ΜΓ Macpherson to have been, as he says himself in
one of his prefaces‚ an early apprentice to the muses.
To shew what he had then acquired in such appren-
. ticeship, a specimen of each poem is annexed in the
Appendix, No. 6.

ΜΓ Macpherson’s papers (called by him the ori-
ginal of Offian), above described, vvere left, as has
been said to ΜΓ John Mackenzie, for the purpose
of publication ; and it is now understood will be

publiffied, as soon as some preliminary difficulties
⁴ean be overcome.
