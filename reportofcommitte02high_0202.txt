The* poem in book the 4th‚ is handed down pretty e‘nti'r& ¹
in this country, in which each of Fingal's chiefs single'sr ¹
out the chief among the enemy he was to fight, leaving td
Fingal the honour of engaging the king of Lochlin. Th'e'
description of the sun-beant, Fingal's standard, does not
corne up to the beauty and spirit os the original. Along
with that of the sun-heom, there-is in the original a parth*
cular description 0¹2⁷ the standards of the seven principa]
chiefs of F ingal, which :tre all so initnitably beautiful that
I cannot imagine how Blacpherson has omitted them in his
translation. Dermod, who led the right hand of the army
to that battle, (as it is express-‚ed in the original‚) had a
standard which, in magnificence, far exceeded the sun- ⁴
'beam- He is, by the tradition of this country, saidv to be the· .
predecessor of the Campbells. ‚

We have the poem containing the battle of Lochlegoff “
and a good partos that relating the war of Inis--thona, in
page 104. ⁷ Ι y ι

It would take up too much room, and Ι think it is not' ,
necessary that I go through all the poenis in the collection,› ·
of which we have pieces joined to other poems, and some-⁴ “’
times parts of two or three poems thrown together intoa
one.

Mr Maepherson‚ in his journey through the Highlands5 ’
put it upon me to look out for the poem called cath, or the ’
battle of Benedin. Ihave since got it, but not till after
the book was published. The battle is the most memo-
rable of Fingal's exploit53 and, I humbly think, the poem j
is the most finished of Ossian’s works.

Upon the whole, Ι know not any capable of doing that
'justice to the original, which Mr Maepherson has done.-
One thing I’m sorry for, his having omitted the descrip-'
tion *which Ossian gives of Fingal's ships, their sails„
masts‚ and riggfflg, their extraordinary feats in sailing'„
