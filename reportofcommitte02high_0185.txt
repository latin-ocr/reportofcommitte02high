LETTERS το m. BLAI'R. is

Ι equal, as far as they go, to any thing that Mr Maepherson

has yet published. If so, the literary world should do

that gentleman the justice to believe, that he is not himself

⁴37 the real author of the compositions he has ascribed to Os-

sian, or should allow that the Highlands have heretofore

produced bards of a character not less exalted than that of
which Ossian was possessed, according to Mr Maepher-
son's account of him.

You desire me to tell impartially how far the translations
given by the publisher of Ossian’s works agree with the
original, as far as I have had occasion to see or hear the
latter.

It is, I think, no easy matter to lay down an exact sys-
tem of rules which a translator should, inviolably observe,
especially when the work in which he is engaged, is of
the poetical kind. Far less is it easy for a critic, a critic
abler beyond comparison than I, to determine, whether
Mr Maepherson has taken unpardonable liberties in his
versi0n3 unless that critic should have a number of manu-
scripts, or one at least, before him. The oral editions
given by the several persons who have rehearsed the very

“ same parts of Ossian’s poenis in my presence, are far from

being exactly the same. Some of these rehearsers omitted
several whole stamas, which others repeated before me.
Some of them invertcd the order of whole sentences, and
whole stanzas. Others differed greatly from the rest in the

q expression, here and there in the sentiments, in the versifi-

canon, in the names of the heroes, and soenes of action;
and that, too, without doing any considerable hurt to the
meritos the poem, all things considered.

Those who are ready to believe that ΜΓ Maepherson
has given his translation of Ossian’s works from an an-

. cient manuscript, cannot pretend to determine that his ver-

sion is too free, too incorrect‚ or faulty in any respect, until
they are ableto compare it with the original contained in
