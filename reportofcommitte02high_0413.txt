Cormac was rousing hi's people to fierceness
Like a hammer sounding· under the strength of hands-3
, And he still pressed on towards Ossian
To engage him in the hard-fought fight.
Five times on the hill
· Did Ossian cleave the shield of stately Cormac:
And Cormac son of Art, v
Broke five green swords upon the heigssft,
I cut away the head of Cormac,
And exposed it to view on the hill:
And Ι retired with the chiefs of Fail
As I held the head by the hair.
Whoever would have told me,
When that day I strove in battle,
Ἰ That I should be in this condition to night,
Could not escape the vengeance of my arm ἔ

Then Fingal himself came forth.
[oud and dreadful he sounded the call,
As he reared his voice on high.

 

 

Five times I shook it by the lock. The friends of Cormac
fied. Whoever would have told me, lovely maid, when
⁸then I strove in battle; that blind, forsaken, and forlorn, I
now should pass the night; firm ought his mail to have
²·been3 unmat‘ched his arm in war! Book IV. page 283,

The king stood by the stone of Lubar. Thrice he rear-
