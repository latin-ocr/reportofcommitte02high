On which Miss Brooke remarks in a note,

“Righ thire na bhfear ngorm.--Literally‚ ‘ The king of
the country of the Moors.’ This seems a strange passage,
and I must confess myself unable to conjecture whence it
could have taken fise, or What connection there could have
been between the Irish and the Moor's.”

From its being wanting in all the editions· that have been
received by the Commfflee, there is reason to regard it as
an interpolation: and it is highly probable‚ that it was
made in the ninth century, when the Moorish Mussulmans
of Africa² after expelling the Goths from the fairest and.

Austria to ‘the‘ base condition of furnishing a yearly tribute
of ahundred beautiful damsels, proceeded to invade and
possess themselves of Sicily (A. D. 828.); whence they
sailed to the mouth of the Tiber, and appeared before
the gates o'f Rome (846), where they struck dread and
horror into the numerous pilgrims who resorted thither
· from all the Christian kingdoms of the west. (Volt. Uni'v.
