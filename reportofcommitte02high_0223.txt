These things (and a thousand other arguments that
might be adduced‚) prove incontestibly that Ossian lived3
‘that he sung at a very early period3 that many of his
best poems are still preserved; and that no other bard has
ever been compared with him by his countrymen.

WRITTEN at Tigheary, in North Uist, on the l2th of
August, 1800, by Mr Edmund Mac Queen, Minis-
ter of the Gospel at Barra, as spoken in Gaelic by
Hugh Maedonald. It was read aloud, word for
word, at the house of Mr Mac Lean of Boreray, in
presence of that gentleman3 of RIajor Alexander
Macdonald of Valay3 of Captain Ewen hiacdon-
ald of Grimiliish3 of Mr James Mac Queen, Mis-
sionary Minister, in Harris; and of Mr Roderick
Mac Neil, younger of St Kilda: All of whom

- declared, that, although what was spoken byHugh
Macdonald, and thus written by Mr Mac Queen,
is perfectly just and‘satisfactory‚ with regard to the
authenticity of Ossian’s poems3 yet,v infinitely
more might be adduced to prove, that Ossian lived
in times far beyond our modern period, and that

his works secure to him exclusively the rank of
he chief of Caledonian Bards.
