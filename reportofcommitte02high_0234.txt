62 LETTERS 'ro MR. MACKENZIE, &a

Ι have thus, my dear Sir, given you as full an account} '
as I could of all that I remember concerning the ‘discovery
and publication of the poems of Ossian. I shall be hap-
py if it give any satisfaction to that very respectable asso-.-
ciation of gentlemen to whom you wish it to be communi-
cated, and to which Ι have myself ‘the honour of belong-
ing, in the station of an Honorary Member. Ι have per-
haps been minute and tedious in my narration of particu-
lars, but as I am now among the oldest persons alive who
had any hand in that discovery and publication, I imagin- ’
ed that even some of the small circumstances I have men-s 3
tioned, may be considered as of some weight. Iconfess Ἰ
I cannot avoid considering the discovery of the works of ’
Ossian as an important aera in the annals of ‘taste and lite-
rature; and the share which I have had, in contributing· Ι
towards it, as a part of my life, by which I have deserved ι,
well both of this age and posterity. I have the honour to ¹
be, with much esteem and respect,

My Dear Sir,
Your most obedient, and
faithful humb‘le servant,
Hucn BLAJR. Α
