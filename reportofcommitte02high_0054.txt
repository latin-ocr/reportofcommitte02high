meaning of some Gaelic words, and that Iwas much

After receipt of this first letter, the Comniittee
‘sent' to Mr Gallie a copy of the circular queries a·-
bove recsted, p. 52, and added an inquiry who the
friend was whom ΜΓ Gallie had mentioned as hav-
ing furnished the passage of Gaelic poetry mentioned
in his letter, and as the only other person who knew
as wellas himself the state of the poetry colle&ed
by Mr Maepherson. To these inquiries ΜΓ Gallie
replied by the following letter. ΜΓ Laing‚ we know,
(for the cireumstance has he n mentioned to him),
will pardon the manner in which his name is men-
tioned; in which, though the zeal of the High
lander, and his prejudice against a supposed un-
friendly distri&³ is not exdnguflhed, it is tempered
by that gentleness which the Committee understands

to have been a principal feature in the good man ’.s
chara&er

Sia,
