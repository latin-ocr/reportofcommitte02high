286 AccoUNT oF

and in this venerable sense it was applied to Bishops in th&
early ages of the Church‚ as we learn from St. Augustin'
and some succeeding writers quoted by Du Gange under .
the word Papa. In the Eastern Church it was, at one pe-
riod, given to Abbots, and even to Priests or Presbyters.
When the Bishops of Rome acquired the direction
of the Western Church, they affected an exclusive right to
the title of Pope, which they continued to assume from the
time of Leo the First, or Great (A. D. 440—-461.), while

others received it only as matter of courtesy. So in the  

Eastern Church, too, it came in process of time to be rno-
nopolized by the Patriarchs of Alexandria3 which mado
some Roman Pontiffs take the title of Universa] Pope, as
John VIII. is styled in the council held at Pavia in the
year 876*.

To apply this information to our purpose: The Scots
and Picts, as we are expressly informed by Bede, derived
their Christian profession from St. John the Evangelist, ac-
cording to the usage of the Churches of Asia, and the wri-
tings of Anatolius, who was Bishop of Laodicea in Syria
about the year 280, and wrote, among other works, a learn-
ed book on the observance of the Pasch, a fragment of
which is preserved by Eusebiuffls. Their clergy, accord-
ingly, long opposed the peculias rites and tenets of the Ro-
mish Church with so much zeal, that they would not even
eat in company with churchmen of that persuasion, whom ’
they, as well as the ancient British and Irish, whose
Christianity was derived from the same source, regarded as
little better than Pagans Ι.
