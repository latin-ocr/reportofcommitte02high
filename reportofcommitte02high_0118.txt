And stood out from among the peopk,

Between the man of might and the king.

The warrior of portly form advanced

With wrath and with strength toward them5
And, past us, he rushed on the maid,

As {he stood by the shoulder of Fingal.

'The son of Morni gave an eager cast

Of his firm spea1·‚ to stay him.

Nor weak was the cast ;

lt parted his shield in twain.

Gaul of the glowing spirit russied on,

To hew down the hero, who stood as a rock of iccst.
W hoever should then behold them,

Furious would seem the strife of death.

The hand of Momi’s son laid low

The king of Sora's son—tale of grief!

sad wer‘e our peopie for the coming of the maid,
On whose account the hero fell in dread affray.
After the mighty had fallen

On ocean's strand, O deed of wo'e !

The daughter of the king of the wave-surmunded land

Remained for a year in the land of Fingal.
&Vc buried‚ by the slde of the water-fall,
T he man of might an'd of prowess ;

And we placed on the point of each finger
,A ring of gold, in honour of the king. θ’
