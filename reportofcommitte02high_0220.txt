48 Tm: TESTIMONY oF

There are a hundred places in the Highlands and Isles‚
which derive their names from the Fe'imzffi and from cir-
cumstances connected with their history. The properties
of the grounds, and the traditions universally attached to
thern, co'rrespond with the strain of Ossian’s poetry. These
traditions have been handed down from generation to gene-
raffion, and still exist. The names of «men, and of efflans·
ur tribes, either prior to Ossian, or coeval with him, which
we can d] mention, prove that the F2³i7me inhabited our
Highlands ‘and Isle53 and we have genealogies of some
famih'es which reach back to these early times, and to some
of the heroes whom he celebrated.

The names of rnen, and of places, are significant to a
degree, found only in an original language: and Ossian’s
expressions are so peculiarly and wonderfully happy, that
no man can translate or change them, without losing the
aptness, 'substance‚ melody, and perfect beauty‚ which
distin-guish the pure Gaelic of Ossian alone, through all his
works.

Besides, we find over the Highlands and Isles many mo-
numents of the good sense andingenuity of Ossian's heroes.
These evince that they possessed arts that enabled them to
perform works, of which their degenerate descendants
cannot comprehend the mefflod, nor even conceive the pos·-
sibility‚ of execution.

Among the powers with which the F &inne had to contend,
in defence of their lands and liberties, or in support of their
allies, we have mention made of “ The king of the
Visorld. '' There is no character to which we can suppose
this epithet apphcabk, excepting the Sovereign-of Rome,
whose controul extended over more of our Globe‚ than

that of any other recorded in history.
The Scandinavians (Lochlinnich) who invaded the Isles

and Highlands, long after the times of the Fessinne, were not
able to change the language‚ or to destroy the monuments „
