Breadalbane, Perthshire, from whom he got a written copy

of it. He declares, That the song called Losga Tigh Fara- χ
birne no Farmafl, he heard recited by many people in the
country above fifty years ago, and as far back as he can
remember any thing, and he is sure he heard it before
M‘Pherson went about to collect the Poenis of Ossian in
the country of Glenorchay : That he learnt this poem some
‘time ago from Janet M‘Kenrick 01· Hendersom, now re-
siding in Glenfalloch, and that she got it from the said
M‘Nicols of Arivean. He further declares, the song or
poem called Duan a Ghairbh mhic Stairu he heard recited
in the country by many persons above forty years ago, and
particularly by Finlay M‘Kenrick or Henderson‚ in
Croitandeor in Glendochart in Perthshire‚ a very old man,
from whom or from John M‘Kenrick his uncle in Glen-
orchay, the said F inlay learnt the song, and that some time
ago, the declarant himself learnt this song by heart from
John M‘Intyre in Stronmialachan in Gknorchay, a man
of about sixty years of age, who had it from Duncan M‘In-
tyre who resided near Bunaw, Argyleshire: Declares, That
he is certain he heard the song of Garbh mac Stairn recited ⁴
by many persons as above, long before M‘Pherson went
about collecting the Poenis of Ossian. Declares, That the
song called Eachdraidh air Conachar Righ Erin agus truir
mhac Righ Bharrach0i1‚ an edition of which M‘Pherson
has published under the name of Darthula, and which is
commonly called in the country, Clann Uisneachain‚ or the
Sons of Usno, he heard recited above fifty years ago by

many persons in Glenorchay, particularly by Nicol M‘Ni- ,
col in Arivean, who resided some time in Achaladar, and · !

this he thinks, was about ten years before M‘Pherson went

about collect-ing the Poems of Ossian. Declares, That in

the collection which he has now deposited with the Society‚

there are several other poems, some of which relat-ing to

the actions of the tace >of Pingal‚ he likewise heard recito&
