TRANSLATION.

Mournful it is to be to-night in the vale of Cona,
Without the voice of hound, and without music 2
My fancy can no longer aceornplish its purpose,
I am truly the old man and the feeble.
When we went to the vale of cona, .
Soft and expressive was the music that accornpanied us ·,
Many were the men of worth among us, Δ ¹
Nor would we willingly meur displeasure.
When we would ascend the pat‘hs of Cona,
Numerous were the parties in every directioh‚
To subdue the hart and the hind,
Many hundreds of which were never to rise.
Many were the heroes, when called upon,
That would rapidly ascend the mountain
With spear exposed in their grasp,
Their great sword and their shield':
While my beloved Fingal and fifty chiefs
Were assembled 111 the lofty court,
And the sun· beam‚ set to its flag· staff,
W aved ov er them its x ictorious banner.
Far would disper-se asunder,
Through the steep banks¹ of each mountain,
The strong, adventurous band of F lngal,
With bows ready in their grasp. Ἰ .
When the deer began to fstart,
We let slip the hundreds of our hounds ·,
Many a hart, roe, and hind
Fen, as far as I could view.
We returned in the evening with the spoils of the chacer
To Taura of the musical strings‚ ‚
Where frequent our cmits and harps,
