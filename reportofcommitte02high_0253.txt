LETTERS TO MR. MACKENZIE. 81

turn to you with such a version as you wanted, before I
left town, for which the best apology I can make is, to

send them now. .
The following lines are taken from the poem entitled,

⁴ “ Cath Fhinn ugus IWhanois ,- from the recitation of Calum

an Raodhair. ’'

ORIGINAL.

Chuir sinn Deo-greine ri crann,
Bratach Fhinn bu ghairge treis,
Lomlan do chlochaibh an eir,
’S ann leinne bu mhor a neas.

Iomadh elaidheamh dorn-chrann οἷαι,
Iomadh srol ga chur ri crann,
An cath mhic Cumhail nam fleadh
'S bu lionmhor sleagh os ar ceann.

LITERAL VERson. ι*
We set the sun-beam to the pole,
The standard of Fingal of stoutest might,
Full-studded with stones in gold3
With us it was held in high respect.
Many were our swords with fist-guards.
Many the standards reared on poles,
In the battle of the son of Curnh'al of feasts,
And many the spears above our heads.

After observing that the different editions of all these
poems differ greatly from each other, (as may well be sup-2
posed, when they were left to the mercy of oral recitation)
and that it is hardly fair to judge of Mr M.’s translation
[without having his own edition, I shall here subjoin his
version of this passage, as it is in Finga1‚ b. iv. p. 57, of
the first 4t0 edition.
