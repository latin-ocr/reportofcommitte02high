TRANSLATION.

IN the house of ‘remora of melodious cruits
As we were engaged ln drinking,

· Mutua] provocation roused to wrath

Cauil, the graceful hero, and Momad the great.
The champions rose to wresfle,
Heavier than lead was the pressure of their feet ;
Afar was heard the panting of their breast83
While sad in suspence stood the heroes of Fingal.
Stones and heavy earth
Were dug up by their heels in strife,
Whilst they struggled during the day
Vsithout determining which was the best in deeds of
strength.
On the morning of the second day,
The champions engaged again,
Carril of the pointed arms of victory,
And Gaul of the keen tempered swordS.
Folded in each other’s grasp,
They anxious twined, and pulled and turned,
Till opposing arms to arms in perilous contest,
The souncl of their strokes was regretted by all.
Often did fire come from their arms
And wrought foam from their white brea'sts ;
Their tough spears were hacked
And their shields hewn down to the ground.
