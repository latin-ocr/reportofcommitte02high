ances, on which the melancholy superstition of the
inhabitants of a mountainous country, in such a
state of society and manners as the poems in question
exhibit, might found their mythology, if it may be
so called, of the ghosts of their ancestors and de-
parted friends. It is contained in the opening of
a poem called ‘ Finan and Lorma,' where the young
people around him, looking on the heavens, address
the aged Offian in the following natural and beauti-
ful verses, of which the >original will be found in

the Appendix, p. 1 87.

The literal transsation is as follows :

‘ The mountajn, O bard ! is bright‚
And the ssiadow of the moon is in Coathan *ς

The ghosts of the mountain speak,

And the voice of a spirit is in the fold of the wind.

ssut it is a different appearance that draws our attention-
Two clouds that hover in the host of night ;

They move over Alva of roes,
vWhile their locks are spread on the gale of the mountain.

³* A river so called, running through Glean Caothan, or the
Vale of eona, as it has been poetically rendered.
