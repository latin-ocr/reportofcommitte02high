Harlaw‚ which was fought near four hundred years ago.
Itis called Brosnachadh cath Ghariach, (invigorating ad-
dress at the battle of Garioch,) and is well known.

As a proof of the estimation in which the bards were
held, I need only mention, that when the chief of the
Mac Leods dismissed Mac Gille Riabhich‚ his family
bard, Macdonald received him hospitably, though he had
always his own family hard, and gave him lands on the
farm of Kilmmey, in Trotternish‚ which retain to this
day the name of Baille mhic Gille Riabhich, (Mac Gille
Riabhich’s town.) Now, it is well known that when the
persons succeeding in the usual line to the office of family
hard, happened to have no talents for original composition,
he was nevertheless bound by his situation, to learn, and
to transmit, to his heir in office, the best compositions of
the bards who went before him.

Those men are much mistaken who believe that neither
kindness nor hospitality‚ disinterested magnanimity‚ gene-
rosity of beart, nor sympathy of soul, were conspicuous
among the Fe‘inne : that neither the knowledge nor practice
of virtue existed in their times ; but that these have lately
, been introduced into our country.

n direct opposition to such conjectures, we can easily
prove, that the noblest virtues have been ruined, or driven
into exile, since the love of money has crept in amongst

, us; and since deceit and hypocrisy have carried mercenary

policy and slavish, sordid avarice into our land. Before
this modern change, our chiefs cherished humanity. They
were warm-hearted‚ determined‚ and immoveable, in sup-
porting their friends, and always proved the shield and
shelter of the feeble. They possessed elevation of senti-
ment, an independent spirit, and unshaken fortitude, which
were the defence of their friends, and the destruction of

their own enemies, and the enemies of their country.
