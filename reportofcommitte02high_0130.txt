Of which his transsation is as follows ε

⁶ Thy strength was like the strength of streams in their foam ς
thy speed like the eagle of Atha? darting on the d'un tr'em‘bling
fawn of the desart. In battle thy path was like the rapid fall of γ
a mountain stream, when it poure its white torrent over the rock, Ι
and sends abroad its grey mists {upon the wings of the winda. '
The roar of its stream is lond through Mora's rocks. Mountain
trees, with all their moss and earth, are swept along between its
arms: but when it reaches the calm sea of the vale, its strength
is lost, and the noise of its course is filent. It moves not the
withered leaf, if the eddying wind doth not aid it. On eddying
:vinds let thy spirit be borne, son of Duiuo, to thy fathers ; but ¹
light let the turs lie over thy beauteous form, and calm in the
grave be thy ssumber!
