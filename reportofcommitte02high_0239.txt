Ῐιι ἀ preface prefixed to this publication, Macpherson‘
announced that there was a great deal of poetry of the
same kind still to be found in the Highlands and Islands 3
and, in particular, that there was one work, of consider-
able length, which deserved to be stiled an Heroic Poem,
'which might be recovered and translated, if encourage-2
ment was given to such an undertaking. A subscription
was immediately set about in the Parliament-House, and
a sum sufficient to make such an important search was soon
collected. Mr Maepherson made two journies through the
Highlands, on one of which Mr Home accompanied him,
and the result was, the publication at London first of Fin-
gal, and then of Temora.

As,- before this accidental meeting with Mr Home, Mt
Maepherson had no idea of collecting and translating the
'works of Ossian, the fact remained on my mind as a
strong ground-work for the evidence of the authenticity of
Ossian, when both the internal and external evidence was
so ably scrutinized by the late Dr Blair. Upon this
ground, I remain fully convinced that Maepherson did not,
and could not, with all his ability, which was great, fabri-
cate the poems3 though I am ready to admit, that after
collecti‘ng all the scattered fragments, he tied them together
inform of heroic pocms, as Homer is said to have done
when he collected the songs of the bards of Greece.

Mac'pherson however had laid himself too much open to
the critics by attempting, in his Dissertations on Fingal‚
to unite two things that must ever remain separate, viz,
poetical fiction and historical truth, which Ι observet has
opened a late violent attack on him, by a writer of history,
which I have little doubt will prove as ineffectual to overa-
throw the authenticity of Ossian, as any of the former
, attacks.

I have only to add, that during my intimacy with Mac«
phet-son for two winters in London, in 1769 and 70, when-
