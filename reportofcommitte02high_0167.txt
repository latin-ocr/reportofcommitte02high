On the whole, the Committee beg leave to
REPORT,

That there are two questions to which it has di·
recled its inquiries, on the subject which‘ „the Socie-
ty was pleased to refer to it, and on whichit now
submits the best evidence it has been able to pro-

CUI‘C·

ht, What poetry‚ of what kind, and of what
degree of excellence, existed anciently in the High-
lands of Scotland, which was generally known by
the denominatim} of Omiamk, a term derived from
„the universal belief that its father and principal com-
poser was Offian the son of Fingal ?

(λεί, How far that colleffion of such poetry‚ pub-
> lilhed by Mr James Maepherson, is genuine?

Ι As to the first of those questions, the Committee
can with confidence state its opinion, that such poe-
try did exist, that it was common, general, and in
great abundance3 that it was of a most impreffive
and striking sort, in a high degree eloquent, tender‚
and sublime.

The second question it is much more difficult to
1answer decifively The Committee is poffeffed os

'no documents, to ihew how much of his ‘colleffion
