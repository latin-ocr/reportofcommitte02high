LETTERS TO MR. MACKENZIE2
“⁸¹¹5’‘-

1. From Doctor JonN Saum, dated Campbelton‚ loth
September 1797,

511³,

Ῑ ΗΑΒ the honour of your letter of the 3lst
ult. with the printed queries circulated by the Highland
Society of Scotland relative to Ossian⁷s poems. On tho
subject of these querie5‚ I advanced all I had to say long '
ago 3 and if any thing fell in my way since2 pro or con, it
was allowed to pass unnoficed, as 1 never intended to be-„
stow any further thoughts upon the matter. If² however3
upon recollecfion, any thing new, or more explicit, shall'
occur to my memory² I shall state it; but cannot help
thinking, with all due deference to better judges2 that the
investigation set on foqt by the Society‚⁴ would do bettet , ³
after the poems should have been first published2 and alt
lowed to speak3 at least in part, for themselves,
