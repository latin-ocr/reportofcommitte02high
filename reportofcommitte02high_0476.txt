The most valuable of theancient MSS. procured by the Γ ³

Society‚ were got from the late Mr. John Maekenzie of the
Temple, Secretary to the Highland Society of London.
One of these is a large collection of poems composed at va.
rious periods‚ which appears to have belonged to the Rev.
James Mac Gregor, Dean of Lismore in Argyllshire. For
on the lower margin of its 27th page (as now numbered by
its remaining contents) is written Lliber Dtu Jacobi
Mi< Grigor Decani Lismoren. Part of it was written in
the year 1512. as appears from the concluding lines of its
144b page-‘⁶ Dulicha- mac Dowle vic Oyine reywich di
sgreyve so a loywrow schenchyth nyn reig· Ao Domin-
millesimo quinm⁰ duodeci1n0.'’ Which means in English,
Duncan-—son of Dougal‚ son of Ewan the grizled‚ wrote

this out of the books of history of the kings in the year of

our Lord 1512. Part of it was written as late as 1527,
which closes an obituary (commencing 1077) of the kings
of Scodand, and other eminent persons of the nation‚ more
especially, those os the shires of Argyll and Perth.

The writer of this MS. rejected the ancient character for
the current handwriting of the time, and adopted a new
mode of spelling conformable to the Latin and English

sounds of his own age and country⁷ but retained the aspirate
mark (‘). Plate III. ΝΟ. 5. shews asae simile of the title

and first six lines of a poem copied from it into the prece· :³¹

ding Report‚ p. 93.
The Welsh had long before made a similar change¹ in

their ancient orthography. Mr. Edward Lhuyd recom- Ἰ

mended it, with some variation, in a Letter to the Scots

and Irish prefixed to his Dictionary of their language in ,

the Archaeologia Britannica. The Bishop of Sodor and
Man observed it in the devotional exer-ciffis, admonition‚

and catechism, which he published for the use of his dio- . ⁴
