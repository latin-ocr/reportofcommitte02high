LETTERS ‘ro MR. MACKENZ'IE, &a Ξῖ-

ing learned that he was possessed of some pieces of the
'³ oldest Highland poetry in the original, requested of him to
show him a translation of one or two of those pieces, as a
“ specimen. Two of these, Which were afterwards publish-v
ed among the Fragments, were accordingly given to Μι-
Home, who admired them greatly, and at some distance of
κ’ time showed them to me as valuable curiosities.

I being as much struck as Mr Home with the high spirit
of poetry which breathed in thern, presently made enquiry
where Μι- Maepherson was to· be found3 and having sent
for him to come to me, had much conversation with him
on the subject. When I learned that, besides the few
pieces of that poetry which he had in his possession, great*
ί er and more considerable poems of the same strain were to-
be found in the Highlands, and were well known to the na-
tives there, I urged* him to translate the other pieces which

he had, and bring them to me; promising that I should .

(take) care to circulate and bring them out to the public, by
whom they well deserved to be known. He was exn-eme-
ly reluctant and averse to comply with my request, saying,
'that no translation of his could do justice to the spirit and
force of the original; and that, besides injuring them by
translation, he apprehended they would be very ill relish-
’ ed by the public as so very different from the strain of moa
dern ideas, and of modern, connected, and polis'ned poetry.
It was not till after much· and repeated importunityr on my
part, and representing to him the injustice he would do to
his native country‘by keeping concealed those hidden trea-
sures, which, Ι assured him, if b1-0115ht forth, would
, serve to· enrich the whole learned world, that I at length
prevailed on him to translate, and bring to me, the several
poetica} pieces which he had in‘ his possession. Them I
published in 1760, sinder the title of Fragments of Ancicnt

Peetry, “collected in the Highlands eff scotland, and wrote the-
