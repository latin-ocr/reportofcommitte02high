The first of these is' the circumstance of the lan-
. guage, in poems of such antiquity, being so nearly
= what it still is, 111 the common use and understand-
ing of the country. Perhaps the fituation of the
j Highlands and 1ssands, where this poetry has been
·’ preserved, and the little communication they had
ζ’ with other countries, may in some measure account
for this circumstance. Language is changed from
its use in society, as coins are smoothed by their cur-
rency in circulation. lf the one be locked up a-
' mong a rude, remote, and unconne&ed people, like
¹ the other when it is buried under the earth, its great
features and general form will be but little altered.
Certain it is, that, with the allowance of a some-
1 what different orthography, and a few words now
in disuse, which the best Celtic scholars could
not make out without the help of the context, the
'language of the ancient MSS. publilhed by Miss
Brooke and others, in Ireland, and also that of those
in the poffesfion of the Society, is very much the
¹ same with that which proficiente in the Gaelic now
write, and ls perfeffly intelligible to such persons.
Another circumstance 01 difficulty is, that any
*human memory should be able to retain poems of
such 1611(Ο 1111, and so numerous, as some of those
- Highlanders, from whose oral recitation the collec-
tors of such poems obtained them, repeated. But
the power of memory in persons accustomed from
their infancy to such repetitions, and who are unable
to affist or to injure it by writing, must not be judg-
ed of by any ideas or any experience poffeffed by
