’Τίήέ fruit, more sweet than virgin homey found,
Serv'd both alike for physic and for food:
It cur’d disemos, heal'd the bleeding wound,
And hunge‘f’s rage for three long days wiffisspod,
But ⁴precious things are purchas'd still with pain,
. And thousands try²d to pluck it, but in vain,

F or at the root of this delightsul tree,
A venomous and awful dragon lay,
, Wiffi watehfu} eyes, 2ss horrible to see,
who drove th’affrighted passengers away,

¹ Worse than the viper’s stiug its teeth did wound,

The wretch who felt it soon behov'd to die3
Νοῑ could physicis-ns ever yet be found

Who might a certain antidoto apply3
Ev'n they whose skill had sav’d a mighty hosq
Against its bite no remedy could boast.

{Revengeful Mey, her fury to appease,
And him destroy who durst her passion slight„

’ ⁷ ⁴ Feign’d to be strichen with a dire dssease,

And eall’d the hapless Albin to her sight:
5‘ Arise, young hero Ξ skill’d in feats of war,
On yonder lake your dauntless courage proves
To pull me of the fruit, now bravely dare,
And save the mother of the maid you love.
I die without its influence divine:
Nor wffl I toste it from a hand but thiae. '' ⁷

With downcast look the lovely youth repIy‘d,
‘⁴ Though yet my feats of valour have been few,
’ My might in this adventure shall be try’d3
Ι go to pull the healing fruit for you. ’'
With stately steps approaching to the deep,
The hardy hero swims the liquid tide z
