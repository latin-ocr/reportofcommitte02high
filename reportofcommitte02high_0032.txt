ized, Fingal‚ exists, and has⁴ immemorially existed
in the Highlands and issands of Scotland, and that
certain poenis or ballads, containing the exploits of
him and his associate· heroes, were the favourite lore
of the natives of those districts. The general belief

Offizm, is a person as well known as strong Sampson

combat of the Fingalians. Ostiam, ‘⁶ an deigh nam fi-
