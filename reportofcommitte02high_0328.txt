nvn. sm,

Ι am favoured with your last letter, inclosing· ’
four poems, for which I am much obliged to you. Ι beg .
you send me what more you can conveniently. I have re· Ι
solved to print by subscription.--I send, inclosed, a copy
of my proposals, that if any in your neighbourhood incline ·
ἰο subscribe, they send their orders, by your means to me,-

the book when published. Ι am now much hurried, so

answer my demands: I wish it may be in my power to
..show how much Ι am,

Reverend Sir,
