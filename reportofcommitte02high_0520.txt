THE DEATR ‚OF 'GARu-L,

Mal-king an their paths with daughter,- ’

“ Tearffil, doleful, is the ‚strain of the F ,ivngalianffi
Deploring the mighty warrior of pleasant smile5
Mournful, sad, does Fingal lament t-hee Α
who shalt be seen no longer in the hall of heroes ἔ

“ Unfortunate was the death of ,the valian't cham-

pion, ⁷
Who fell without war, in a due-1.
Like a cloud of night he departed from us 3
sad is the tale we ate left to mourn ἔ

.“ The maids of Sora will raise the strain of woe,

On account of the fair and lovely youth ;
As the mountain mist is each tendes<- fair,
Dropp'mg tears, as she wails with stifled voice.
“ The hero‚ vigorous‚ strong and tall,
Is now without motion, arms, or dress.
Narrow and level is the place of thy repose‚
On the margin of the meadow-Great is our wound of
woe l f

“ Upon the pebbly strand thou didst constantly move,
On the boisterous, white-soaming ocean ; ⁴
Musical, melodious in the field,

In the time of hunting the full grown deer.

. “ O! h'ero mild, chearful, beloved,

Eloquent, vigomus, active, expert to wound ς
Like a strong stream amongst enormes,—
Farewell, beloved of the sharp blades !”
