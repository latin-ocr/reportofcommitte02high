with declaring, is studious to avoid any approach to
wards controversy, satisfied with producing authori-
ties, rather than ambitious of deducing arguments
from them. .

As the pamphlet of ΜΓ Hill is not in general cir-
culation‚ a specimen of the poetry which he colle&-
ed, and of the remarks which it suggested to him,
are inserted in the Appendix, No, VIII. To these
are subjoined some remarks on Mr Hill’s publica-

non,

countrymen estimated so highly. Scotland was, in some degree,
a foreign country to Johnson. His pcculiar taient might per-
haps be said to consist in clothing ordinary sentimcnts in imperial
language 3 but he had tha¹ {kin to make the garment fit so well,
that, like handicrafts dressed for a pageant‚ the proper rank and
value of the sentimenta were frequently forgotten in the gorgeous·
ness of their robes. VVere the charadier of Johnson and of hi&
writings to be drawn with that severity which he sometimes in-
dulged in his account of others, considerable deductiori would
be made from the merits of botl13 yet, with all the abatcments
which such severity might state, it would still leave behind a cha-
ratker of extraordinary powers and uncommon endowments‚ of
wisd0m‚ discernment, imagination‚ learning, piety, benevolence,
which their attendant weakneffes (weakness'es greatly owing to
an originally morbid constitution), dogmatism‚ prejudice, super-
stition, and partiality, though they might sometimes obscure or
missead, could never extinguissi or altogether overcome. The
Society will pardon its Committee for this note, which it hopes
will not be thought impertinent in mentioning a man to whom
national prejudice on either side of the Tweed has often been
partial cr unjust, and whose xdecifion on the subject of the Com-
mittee’s inquiries has been adopted on one fide, or censured on

the other, with deference or contempt alike unwarrantable and
unfoundcd.
