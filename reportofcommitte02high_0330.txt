F ly, Hy, foul flend, and leave the ma‘ngled world
Too long thy prey, gh me! shall hapless man

F or ever, ever feel thy ir‘dri rod ?

Come, Pessce, come3 life-befrienffing, lovely fair.,‘
A thousand graces ’tend thy placid reign,

Stretch thy soft pinspns o'er a. happy world
Draw the sharp weapon from the warrior's hand-,¹
And chace the jarring monster down to hell..-
Let Science saise on high her dtooping head,
And Muses mne the soxd-delightin'g lay-m

In vain the poet ghdes in meki-ng streams„⁴

In vain attunes his soul to tunefu] woe3

Deaf is the ear of Discmd, dim the eye

Of war, and happ'iness' sas fiies‘ fr<²>m ἐξιὲἐῙι. ²
Come, Contemplation, then, my lonely sah-4
Solemnly walking‚ unaffected grace 1

Absorpt from life, Ι 'j'oin thy sable nain,

And turn my aching eye from Adismal' war.
