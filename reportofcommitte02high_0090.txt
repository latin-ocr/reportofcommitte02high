Ἠ REPORT ON THE

This ‘ Address to the Sun in Carthon' the Com»
mittee was the more solicitous to procure, and to
lay before the Society‚ because it was one which
some of the opposers of the authenticity of Offian's
¹ poems had quoted as evidently spurious, betraying
the most convincing marks of its being a close irni-
tation of the address to the sun in Milton.

The Committee will quote another extra& from
this publication of Dr Smith's, which exhibits a ten-
derness of a different kind. It is part of the lamen-
tation of Graine’, on the death of her lover Dargc),
supposed by her to have been killed by a boar.

‘ Mar

comest forth in thy awful beauty3 the stars hide themselves in the
ss<y3 the moon, cold and pale, finks in the western wax-e. But
thou thyself movest alone 3 who can be a companion of thy course?
The oaks of the mountains fall; the mountains themselves decay
with years3 the ocean ssirinks and grows again3 the moon her·
self is lost in heaven: but thou art for ever the same ; rejoicing in
the briglitness of thy course. When the world is dark with tern-
pests; when thunder1·olls‚ and lightning flies3 thou lookest in
thy beauty from the clouds, and laughest at the storm. But to
Offian, thou lookest in vain ; for he beholds thy beams no more ;
whether thy yellow hair flou-s on the eastern clouds, orthon trem-
blest at the gates of the west. But thou art perhaps, like me,
for a season 3 thy years will have an end. Thou {halt sseep in th)-
clouds‚ careless of ‘che voice of the morning. Exult then, O sun,
in the strength of thy youth! Age is Cark and unlovely3 it is
like the gljmmering light of the rrosx, when it {hines through
broken clouds, and the mist is on the hills3 the blast of north is

on the plain, the traveller ssxrinks in the midst of his journey.
