. LETTERS To DR. BLAIR. Ἴ

’ in the name os our ffiendship, country, and several things
more, to do what you may require at my hands.
ἶ, ' To say the truth, I am not sanguine in my exPe-:tations

from any one manuscript that can be found in our part of
the Isles. Mr NIacphers-:m was himself in the Isle where

the hereditary sennaehies, of whom I have been speaking,

resided for severalvcenm‘ries: he saw tffze friends of these
Ἰ

·, sennachies‚ and saw Clanranald. whether he nas procur-

ed any 01d papers fit for his purpose from these people, he
can inform you best.
As to your second question, I hope to give you some sa·-

’κ’ 'tisfaction within a little time. I shall make rhe strietest

enquiry for all the persons within twenty miles of my

house, who can rehearse, from memory, any part of the
poems contained in Mr “Maephersoffls Fingal, δῖε. His
Temora I have not been able to procure. Ι have begun
this work already, and emertain hopes, to me very pleas-
ing, that my endeavours will be amended with some suc-
cess. Your commands with regard to the exactness of the
translation, the pages of the book, and {he names of the
persons who rehearse from memory, shall be aithsussy
executed.

I fancy there is no great difficulty in showing how such
compositions have been transmitted from one generation to
another. The degree of credit due to such traditionary re-

* ” cords as have preserved them, Ι shall in my next letter

p‘1'ace in the justest and best light possible.

The people in the western parts of Ross-shire‚ know a
great deal more concerning the old heroic poems, or epic
fragments, of the Gaeh'c tongue, than-our islanders of the

. northern quarter. The people Ι mean, are those of Ger-
“ -Ioch, Lochbr00m‚ and Assin. Mr james Robertson, mi-

ffistefof Loehbr00m‚ may possibly be of use 1¹0 you, if

Ι· tonsuhed. I would have written to him upon the head
