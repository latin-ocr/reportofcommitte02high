oF THE ORIGINAL· ,115

He sefaed the mountain ash by the top,
And tore a braneh from· the trunk5
But as he was taking his steps t'oward land,
The rouzed monster observed him.

Overtook him as he was swimming,
And gras-ped his hand in its gaping gorge-
Fraoch seized the monster by the jaw3
Would Fraoch had now his dagger l

The monster mangled his bosom fair,
And gnawing tore his arm away.
The white-handed maid went in haste,¹
Bearin'g a dagger which proved of no avail.

The conflict was but a conflict of short continuance,
His hand still held by its head:

Woful was the endssof the strife
Between Fraoch, son of Fiach, and the monster.

They fell sole to sole,
At those brown stones on the shore 2
Which as the gentle maid beheld,
She fell on the beach a cloud of mist. *ἓ

When she awoke from her torpor,
She took his sostened hand in hers,-
“ Though you be to night a mangled prey for f0W182
Great is the deed you have performed. ⁷’ ⁷
