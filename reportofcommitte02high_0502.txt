My curse b'e eri niy nio'the'r‚

Which made m'e piaetise feat's· of arms
Against you, O Cfichu‘illih.

When I behold the arms of the hero,

The shield and the s'w'vord of Conlaclu
I am such in lamenting,

 

As a man without son or spo'use.

 

Well it is for the victorious Laoghaire
That he did not win, as an instrument of destructionf
This red shield or this sword.

 

Alas! that it was not in Munster of plains„
Or in Leinster of edged swords‚
Or in Cruachan of the fierce wan-ion,

That my beloved Conloch fell.

Had you been killed in battle,
In Sfiaih dr in Hesperia,
Or in the land gf Saxons, of freepeople,

It is exceeding well for the men of Albion.

ὃ Dundealgan is the ancient name of Dunkeld, a wellfknown town of the
county Louth in lreland 3 and a place in the Isse of sky mlh-etaim the name
Dunschich. ·
