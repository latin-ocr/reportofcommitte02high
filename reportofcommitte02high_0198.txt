sired, by nien upon whose judgment he could, with they ’,
most per'fect security, rely. Now, if we pay Mr Mac- ·
pherson the extravagant compliment of supposing him the J-
real author of the several poems in his collection, why j
should he chuse, without temptation or necessity, to expose ⁹
himself to the hazard of being detected of an imposture, a ,Ξ
thing which every Highlander had in his power, rather q
than to acknowledge them for his own, when he was so 'fi
well assured, by some of the best judges of poetical merit ,ἐ

with all the important airs of an heroic poet; for it will ,14
not, Ι pres sume, be said, that these poems derive all theirj'}
merit from the name of Ossian, and the consideration of ἡ,
⁴their antiquity. This species of fraud could be detected ἦέ
by Highlanders only, and it might escape even them for 511
some time. As to profes se'd crines, 1hey never could 141
