LETTER FROM MR. PorE. 55

, 'was 'out of regard to the meinory of that hem. Iasked
, him if he thought that the spirit of that hero was present3
he said n0t; but he thought it well became them who de-
, scended from him to honour his memory. I have thus en-
tertained you with the best agccounts Ι can give you at pre-
sent οξ these warriors. If iffhad not been confined by the
gout I could go more minutely to work3 but if a little
money was laid out in collecting what of these poems are
still extant, it would make a larger volume than the Te-
mora. If you think that it would be of any service to
communicate a part οξ this letter to Dr Blair, you are very
welcome3 and if I ‘can serve the Doctor in any thing
further, I shall exert myself to serve him. I am,
Reverend and Dear Brother,
Your very humble servant,
ALEx. PorE.
